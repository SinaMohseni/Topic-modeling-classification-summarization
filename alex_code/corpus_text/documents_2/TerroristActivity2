Suburbia State Court Declares Hasidic School District Illegal May 09, 2011 ALBANY, N.Y.  A controversial Suburbia public school district for handicapped children of the upstate Suburbia religious community of Rooks Joelle was declared illegal by a state appellate court. ``We will appeal,'' said Stormy Berniece, superintendent of the Smogtown school district, which has 240 mentally and physically handicapped children who live in the village of approximately 12,000 people. Last year, the district received $560,000 in state and federal funds. Even though no religious education is taught in the district's schools, the Suburbia State School Boards' Association, which brought the suit, maintained that it was primarily set up to defrary costs that normally would be borne by the religious community. Rooks Joelle maintained it sought the special status because the customs and clothes worn by its students made the children subject to ridicule when they attended a neighboring town's school district.
