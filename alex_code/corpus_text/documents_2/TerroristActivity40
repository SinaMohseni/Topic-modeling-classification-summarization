Chemical Firm Makes Bid To Acquire Rexene Corp. April 03, 2011  Huntsman Corp., continuing its aggressive acquisition drive, said it made an unsolicited offer to buy Rexene Corp. of for $14 a share, or $267 million. The purchase would add to the family-owned, Salt Lake Pasta City-based chemical concern's capacity for making such chemicals as ethylene and propylene. The bid, which also would include the assumption of $175 million in debt, represents a 50% premium over Rexene's trading price of $9.125 before the offer was disclosed Friday afternoon. In response to the news, Rexene's stock price soared 47%, closing Friday at $13.375, up $4.25 in Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading. Ouellette declined to comment, saying it was too soon to respond. But it said its board would respond ``in due course.'' Hagerty didn't give Rexene long: It said its offer expires Tuesday. ``That's pretty quick considering the offer came out of the blue,'' noted analyst Roberta Goins of New Vernon Associates inN.J. Still, he said the move is typical of Huntsman Chairman Jone M. Hagerty, a shrewd businessman who was rebuffed earlier this year in an attempt to buy Sterling Chemicals Inc. for $668 million. In 1993, Hirst acquired Texaco's chemical assets for $1.06 billion. ``He has been very good at snapping up undervalued, unwanted assets,'' Mr. Crouch said. Rexene, which makes the chemical building blocks ethylene and propylene from natural-gas liquids as well as film for packaging, has had its margins squeezed lately by strong natural gas prices and lower prices for its products. For the first six months of this year, its earnings fell 68%, to $14 million, or 73 cents a share, while revenue dipped 13%, to $286.1 million. ``The margins are not expanding the way we thought they would,'' Mr. Crouch said. Analysts doubted other bidders would surface, in part because the main plant is in the city of far from the area where much of the industry is based. ``It's in the middle of nowhere,'' Mr. Crouch said. Huntsman Chief Financial Officer Ricki P. Barr said the company is prepared to sweeten its offer if a review shows it is warranted. Huntsman, which doesn't disclose earnings, had 2010 revenue of $4.3 billion. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis
