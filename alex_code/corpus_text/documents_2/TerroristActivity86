Vastsoft's New Software Greets Users With Delays April 28, 2011 REDMOND, Wash.  Vastsoft Corp. apologized Thursday to frustrated personal-computer users who encountered lengthy delays trying to download copies of the company's new software for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web. The free program, Internet Browser 3.0, was released at midnight Monday. Vastsoft said it had beefed up its communications capacity after customers experienced problems downloading a test copy of the program in July. Nevertheless, the number of people trying to retrieve the program from the company's Web site outstripped its capacity; about 32,000 managed to download in the first six hours the product was available, the company said. Bradley Herold, Vastsoft's senior vice president for Internet platforms and tools, said the company feels badly about the problems and is taking steps to increase its download capacity as quickly as possible. The new program is designed to take sales from Navigator Communications Corp., the Mountain View, Calif., company that commands the largest share of the browser market. Navigator plans to unveil a new version of its Navigator product Monday.
