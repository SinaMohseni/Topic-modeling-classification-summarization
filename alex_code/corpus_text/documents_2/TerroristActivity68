Large Number of Weapons Found During Traffic Stop May 16, 2011  Routine daily arrest reports from published police actions revealed a routine traffic stop of a truck in Cornertown resulted in an arrest of one individual. The alert staff of Vastpress, not accepting this report as normal, checked our sources within the police department. We have determined that the individual arrested is Samuel Stansbury. He has been in police custody before with connections to the radical organization called Network of Hate. We further found that the FBI, as well as the military, were called to check on the contraband in his vehicle. Included were 3 surface-to-air missiles. We will attempt to get more information, but the story may have already been ``classified''.
