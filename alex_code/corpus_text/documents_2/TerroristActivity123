Update on Animal Deaths April 14, 2011  Suspicions about the mass livestock deaths on April 1 have been raised today. Police detective Beatrice Brothers was investigating witness accounts that several suspicious individuals were trespassing at farms where the mass livestock deaths were reported. Brothers says that no trespassers have been identified yet. It seems very odd that so many trespassers were seen at these sites after the deaths. One nearby resident commented that they may just be sick individuals who wanted to see the carnage. Others believe they were up to no good.  Multiple farmers were questioned if they had received any threats recently. All the farmers stated they knew of no one with ill will against them or their livestock.  VastPress 2011 Vastopolis
