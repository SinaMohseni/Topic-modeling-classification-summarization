Suspicious Turkey Found with Man at Airport May 14, 2011  Transportation Safety Administration members at the Vastopolis airport coordinated with security personnel to detain a man carrying a frozen turkey. This picture was bad enough, but this turkey (not the man) had wires coming out of it. Official Jerry Loudermilk of the TSA indicated that he did not know what to think. But, whether it was a bomb or a sick joke, they are required to treat the package as a bomb pending further verification. The man carrying the turkey was on his way to the west coast. His identification is being verified. Loudermilk noted that he could have tried to check the turkey in with his baggage. But we are happy he tried to get it through the terminal check point. We are not sure about this individual and his state of mind but he is being questioned at the present time. Loudermilk stated that no other delay within the airport was set into motion except one. The flight of the intended aircraft will be delayed to verify none of his baggage is in the cargo hold. If all baggage cannot be accounted for, we will have to inspect the entire cargo again and that will cause a serious delay for the flight. More to come on the case of the suspicious turkey.
