Suspects Apprehended May 13, 2011   Police authorities apprehended three people suspected to be part of a homegrown terror cell, Paramurderers of Chaos. Police refused to provide information on the cause of the raid or additional details of the operation itself. But informed sources, believed to be reliable, revealed that the suspects were in the middle of construction of some type of laboratory in the basement of the structure where they were apprehended. For some reason, the address could not be revealed. However, the suspects must have had some warning of the pending raid. Instead of escaping they destroyed most of the equipment, and therefore most the evidence. What was left looked like expensive high-end workbenches along with stacks of Petri dishes. Our attempts to contact the Police Commissioner for information was said to be ``delayed''.
