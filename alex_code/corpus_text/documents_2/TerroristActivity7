Animal Activist Threatens Press May 09, 2011  A group called Citizens for the Ethical Treatment of Lab Mice, believed by city officials to be connected to the Brotherhood of Antarctica, has been sending emails of a threatening nature to VastPress. It seems they are upset with the experiments applied to mice. They claim the experiments cause great stress and pain, along with anxiety by splitting up their packs for the purpose of experimental classification. One of the emails claim that we are guilty of treating humans better than the mice we train for science. We would like to pursue this thought but are unsure how to contact the leader in the group. The threats are rather strange, with the intent to ``free'' all mice in the city and use humans for experimental purposes. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis
