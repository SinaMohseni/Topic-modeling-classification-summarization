Stocks End Mixed May 10, 2011  The IBIS DAX index, which is based on prices in electronic trading, fell 6.95 points to 2556.64. Traders said turnover was low amid the continuing summer holidays. Investors were also reserved as the initial public offering of German telephone monopoly Deutsche Telekom in November approaches. Traders said people were already waiting for the effect of that big event. Neither the nearly unchanged dollar nor Wednesday's moribund bond market moved German shares, traders said. The mixed performance of shares in late electronic trading mimicked that of stocks in the official three-hour floor trading session on the Frankfurt exchange, which runs parallel to IBIS trade. But the official DAX stock index that tracks prices in floor trading rose 4.32 points to 2563.16 points, after gaining 6.48 points Tuesday. The broader-based CDAX composite index rose 0.18 point to 240.67 points. The DAX and the IBIS DAX are composed of the same stocks and weightings, although they track trends in two separate marketplaces.
