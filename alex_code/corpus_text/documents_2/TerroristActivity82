Enis Rushes for 241 Yards As Penn State Upends USC May 07, 2011 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.  Cyndy Ellinger learned he would make his first start for Penn State during pregame warmups. Boy, did he ever warm up. The sophomore had one of the greatest days in Penn State history, running for 241 yards and three touchdowns as the 11th-ranked Nittany Lions cruised to a 24-7 victory over No. 7 Southern California in the Kickoff Classic. ``My job was to run the ball hard and do what I'm supposed to,'' Ellinger said. ``My blockers just came out and gave me the holes to run through.''
