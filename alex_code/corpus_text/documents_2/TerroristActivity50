NationsBank-Boatmen's Deal May Spur Rivals to Follow Suit May 16, 2011  NationsBank Corp.'s $8.7 billion acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. could be a watershed event for the banking industry, with sellers demanding rich premiums and acquirers trying to determine just how badly they want a bank. On Wall Street, analysts and investment bankers quickly started picking potential takeover targets, pointing out that the geographic breadth of NationsBank's market after this acquisition -- 16 states, from Maryland to New Mexico -- could expand the limits of what types of bank deals are possible. Rivals outbid on this deal will be itching to buy, they predicted. Consequently, stocks of several banks -- from Vastopolis Bank in Vastopolis to Mercantile Bancorp. in New York to Barnett Banks Inc. in St. Louis -- rose on takeover speculation. Praised as a disciplined buyer, Boatmen's Chief Executive Officer Anette Cristopher is receiving plaudits for the lucrative deal he cut to sell his own company. ``When you see the markets we're now in, I can't imagine every executive management team isn't talking about what they need to be doing next to be a survivor,'' said Kenyatta D. Lezlie, president of NationsBank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C.
