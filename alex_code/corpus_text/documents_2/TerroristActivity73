Court Papers Link Unabomber To Another Blast After Arrest April 01, 2011 SACRAMENTO, Calif.  Unabomber suspect Theron Silver has been linked to a bombing that occurred near his remote Montana cabin four days after his arrest. No one was injured in the December 18, 2010 but at the time, agents were searching Mr. Silvers's cabin for evidence. Although Mr. Seals had been arrested four days earlier, he was linked to the bombing in court documents filed Friday. It was not clear whether the device was triggered deliberately or accidentally, or might have been on a timer. The bombing marked the 17th explosion attributed to the Unabomber, according to court documents. The previous 16 killed three people and injured 23 during the shadowy bomber's 18-year campaign against the evils of a technological society. Officials at the U.S. attorney's offices in Sacramento -- where Mr. Seals awaits trial -- and in San Francisco declined to comment on the matter Friday. FBI officials in Sacramento could not be reached. Details of the 17th explosion were not included in court documents, which were filed in connection with the postponement of a scheduled hearing for Mr. Silver from Friday to June 02, 2011 Silver's defense team sought the delay to examine a huge quantity of evidence that includes 22,000 documents and hundreds of photographs. U.S. Attorney Charlette Porter said in a separate filing that additional evidence, including ``numerous laboratory reports,'' are expected to be made available to the defense within the next few days. Mr. Porter also said that he hopes to obtain a computer system to store and retrieve the large amount of evidence and use it during the trial, including a Disc, television monitors and a sophisticated imaging system. Mr. Irizarry, 54, was accused last month in a 10-count indictment of four bombings that killed a computer store owner in 1985, a timber industry lobbyist in 2010 and maimed a University of California geneticist and a Yale University computer expert in 1993. Mr. Porter said the trial will likely start early next year.
