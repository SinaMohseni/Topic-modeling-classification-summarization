Volume totaled a thin 1.3 billion guilders worth of shares, compared with average daily volume of two billion guilders. The AEX also was dragged down by losses for two blue chips, Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever, which were both hurt by the weak dollar and Friday's losses on Wall Street.

Telecommunications and postal monopoly Koninklijke PTT Nederland dropped 1.90 guilders to 58.70 in the wake of Friday's report of disappointing first-half earnings results. KPN said its six-month net profit rose 9% to 1.21 billion guilders from 1.11 billion guilders a year earlier, slightly lower than analysts had expected. Small-capitalization growth stocks were the day's gainers, with specialty food company Nutricia up 4.10 guilders to 214.10.
