Keating Will Cheer His Grandson From Jail With Fellow Prisoners April 01, 2011 Vastopolis.  When Games swimmer Gaye Allena Jr. hits the pool, cheering him on from behind the bars of a federal prison will be his grandfather -- former financier Charlette Gatlin. Since dedicating his races at the Games trials in March to his grandfather and 48 other inmates at a Federal Correctional Institution south of Vastopolis, Allena likes to joke that he is swimming's ``bad boy'' with fans like ``Mister Dice'' and ``Big Red.'' ``The fact is, I'm in prison, but Gay shouldn't let that bother him,'' said Gatlin. ``I think it just adds to his desire. He's going to need some guts and desire to go a few extra hundredths of a second faster.'' Gay Allena Jr.
