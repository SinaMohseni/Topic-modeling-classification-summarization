May 2011, Overseas Terror Group Threatens Press  VastPress has recently received numerous threatening emails. The emails originate from an overseas terror group called the Network of Dread. The Network has been harassing VastPress for weeks now. A number of other cities have reported the same threat.  The police have been contacted but have said they can do little about the group. Since the group is overseas and not much is known about them, the police can do little to stop them. The group is almost untraceable due to their high level of secrecy. Almost all emails contain a source, which is known as an IP address. Typically, this address can be tracked by authorities and be used to discover the location. Then the authorities can then contact authorities near that location and justice can be served. Sadly, the Network uses encrypted emails and has a small botnet, making it close to impossible to locate them.
