Shares Fall Amid Low Volume April 29, 2011  The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index slipped 20.99 to 6228.62, following Friday's 35.32-point fall. Volume was at 583.1 million shares. Decliners led gainers 186 to 134, with 104 issues ending unchanged. Saturday's trading volume was the lowest since November 19, 2010 the market suffered from China's military intimidations. ``Investors are camping on the sidelines awaiting a clearer government policy (toward China),'' said Herma Mcconnell, a specialist at Yuanta Capital Management. The local bourse fell ever since President Leeanna Teng-Huong's remarks Wednesday pointed out Taiwan's heavy reliance on the mainland market. Taiwan shares, particularly those of companies with investments in China, have been falling since Wednesday on fears of a change in the allowed ceiling for investments on the mainland.
