Second-Tier Stocks Gain May 05, 2011  The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 1.28 to 1119.48. Volume was 176.3 million shares, valued at 1.33 billion ringgit. Despite the selling pressure, advancers led decliners 320 to 215, with 153 shares unchanged and 69 untraded. Analysts said that was because some of the smaller, second-board shares that aren't in the composite index were picked up by investors who have ``selected interest'' in the shares. Analysts said the light volume indicated that investors weren't interested in buying stocks and that would probably lead those holding them to sell, pushing the index down. The Second Board Index, which tracks the smaller shares, climbed 6.43 to 511.43. The Emas Index, which tracks all main-board shares, gained 0.34 to 322.33. Among the blue-chip shares that fell were DCB Holdings, which fell 10 sen to 7.60 ringgit; and R.J. Reynolds, which slipped 15 sen to 7.15 ringgit. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis
