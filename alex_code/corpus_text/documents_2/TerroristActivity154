Rail Workers' Union Reaches Pact, Cutting Strike Threat  Vastopolis --  The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees reached a contract settlement with major freight railroads, lessening prospects for a nationwide rail strike this week. The agreement, which was expected, covers wages, health and welfare benefits and work rules for track workers, subject to ratification by union members and resolution of a labor protection issue involving Conrail Inc., Philadelphia. A group bargaining for the freight carriers declined to provide details of the settlement. Freight railroads said they are continuing to negotiate with the Transportation Communications Union to reach an agreement prior to the end of a ``cooling off'' period in the labor talks at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
