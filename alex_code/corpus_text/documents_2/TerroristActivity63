ValuJet Conducts Test Flight To Prepare for FAA Inspection April 29, 2011  ValuJet, grounded after its deadly crash in the has returned to the air to prepare crews for in-flight tests next week as the carrier moves toward resuming commercial operation. A flight crew took a DC-9 on a round-trip flight Friday without any problems, airline officials said. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Federal Aviation Administration inspectors will join ValuJet crews on board several flights to test their readiness on emergency procedures, said ValuJet spokesman Gregory Ebert. ``We view today as a significant milestone,'' Mr. Ebert said. ``We have an aircraft that is up and ready to go and certified by the FAA.'' The airline has set a target date of May 05, 2011 have seven aircraft certified by the FAA to fly to five as-yet unnamed cities, Mr. Ebert said. ``It's our goal within a 45-day period to gradually build up to 15 aircraft with service to 17 cities,'' he said. The FAA grounded ValuJet on February 27, 2011 concerns about airplane maintenance following the January 21, 2011 of Flight 592. All 110 people aboard the DC-9 were killed. Initially, airline officials said they hoped to be flying again within 30 days. But as the investigation into the cause of crash and the FAA safety review continues, the airline has remained grounded. ``We're now in the very final stages of really resolving any outstanding issues that may remain. It's a fine-tuning process,'' Mr. Ebert said. Meanwhile McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has a $1 billion airplane contract with ValuJet, has been pushing Congress to make sure the airline is not subjected to undue delays in its efforts to get back in the skies. McDonnell Douglas' approach has been to contact members of the House and Senate, asking that they urge the FAA not to subject ValuJet to costly delays in recertification.
