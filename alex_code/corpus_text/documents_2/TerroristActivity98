Explosions at Smogtown Chemical Plant May 17, 2011  Vastpress has been monitoring events around the recent explosion within the chemical plant at Smogtown. A consensus exists among local residents that the explosions were caused by some kind of terrorist act. There appears to be little evidence to support the assertions except that the residents have been observing ``unusual'' activity by people not identified as long time residents. Citizens also claim to be well informed by media information and therefore have come to their own conclusions. Our discussions with Fire Chief Philip Stanley continue to show his confidence that the explosion was nothing more than an accident and that terrorism was not involved, despite what the medial has rumored. He indicated that this entire matter has him exhausted. ``I just want to go home to my wife and family'', he said.
