NCR, IBM Are Awarded Contracts by Post Office April 26, 2011 Suburbia   The U.S. Postal Service awarded contracts totaling $218 million to NCR Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. for 18,200 electronic cash registers to be used at post offices. NCR will supply 9,100 of the cash registers, called point-of-service terminals, beginning in March 2012 under a $119 million contract. NCR, a Dayton, Ohio, unit of VastComm Network Corp., is to be spun off this year. IBM will supply the same number of terminals, although with slightly different features, starting in May 2012 under its $99 million contract. Under a three-stage rollout, the Postal Service plans to install more than 73,000 point-of-service terminals in 20,000 post offices by the end of 2014. The terminals combine an electronic scale and a cash register. They can perform such tasks as accepting credit and debit cards and providing information like ZIP codes to customers and postal clerks.
