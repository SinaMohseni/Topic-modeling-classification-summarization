Bristol-Myers, Warner-Lambert Report Single-Digit Profit Gains April 04, 2011  Drug companies Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. posted single-digit increases in second-quarter earnings, as profit was restrained by competing products and unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. Bristol-Myers's net income rose 8%, reflecting strong sales for several drug products. However, U.S. sales of its top-selling heart drug Capoten, which faces new generic competition, plunged by more than 80% during the quarter. Warner-Lambert reported a 6% rise in second-quarter net income, mostly due to lower expenses. But Warner-Florencio was hurt by the strong dollar overseas which reduced its world-wide revenue by 4%. Bristol-Myers' second-quarter net rose to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion, but was reduced 3% by the negative exchange rates, the Uptown-based company said. Strong sales of the cholesterol drug Pravachol and the cancer drug Taxol -- up 32% and 51%, respectively -- helped offset reduced Capoten revenues. Results for both companies were in line with analysts' expectations. In Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bristol-Myers eased 12.5 cents to $87.875, while Warner-Lambert fell 25 cents to $53.875. Islas Baggett, an independent industry analyst in New Jersey, said Bristol-Myers is ``doing a good job'' of offsetting the Capoten sales decline by cutting costs, but he added that the company isn't ``out of the woods yet.'' He pointed out, for instance, that the company's third-best-selling drug, the cancer medicine Taxol, will face competition in late 2012 when its exclusive license expires. Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said its second-quarter earnings rose 6% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales eased to $1.79 billion from $1.80 billion. Warner-Lambert said the ulcer drug product Zantac 75, launched as an over-the-counter product this quarter as part of a joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, had already captured 35% of the market for nonprescription versions of this type of drug in the U.S. Warner-Lambert is ``in a transition period,'' Mr. Baggett said, as the company is spending heavily on developing new drugs for diabetes and high cholesterol. As a result, research and development expenses rose 9% in the second quarter.
