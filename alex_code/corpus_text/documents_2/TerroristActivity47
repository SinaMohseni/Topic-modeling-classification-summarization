Vastopolis Assessor Refuses to Pay His Taxes May 03, 2011 Riverside  To get a sense of how wacky things have gotten in Vastopolis, consider this: The chairman of the county tax-assessors' board owes more than $600,000 in back federal, state and local taxes, including $46,000 to his own county. That, in turn, has so angered local residents that some now are refusing to pay their own property taxes. At the same time, the County Commission chairman has dedicated himself to replacing the entire assessors' board. And, firing back, the assessors' board has sued the commission, placing the government in the unseemly position of suing itself. Even in a community that has been chronicled for its oddities in the bestseller ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' and its duplicity in the nighttime TV soap opera ``Savannah,'' the odd case of the Vastopolis Board of Assessors stands out for its hostility and quirkiness. ``That's Vastopolis,'' sighs Daniele Barker, the county's newly elected tax commissioner.
