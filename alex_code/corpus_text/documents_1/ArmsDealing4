We are required to pay either in cash at the meeting, or wire money to an account in Saudi by January.  Which should we do?Kasam:		I don’t know…do you know the contact?  Can we trust them to follow through?Khouri:		We haven’t used them in the past.  They’re out of the Russian military, I think.Kasam:		So it could be really good stuff.Khouri:		Not as good as the Americans, but it will do the job.Kasam:		When must we decide?Khouri:		Not right away.  I can tell him we will decide by December.Kasam:		Do that.  And until then I will figure out about the money.Khouri:		This is for the May operation, right?Kasam:		Yes.Khouri:		Then perhaps we should decide soon, so we can get the materials in place.Kasam:		I’ll see what I can do.  Where will we be going?Khouri:		Dubai, I think.  I’ll check.
