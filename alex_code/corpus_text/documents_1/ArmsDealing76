Report Date:  23 September 2008  from SABA, Yemen News Agency   Yemen addresses arms trade SANA'A, Sep. 23 (Saba) - Interior Minister Tolah al-Kalid said on Tuesday that Yemen will never allow weapons trade to be back being completely crushed in this past summerâ€™s crackdown. Al-Kalid was quoted by the state-run TruthToday.net as warning that the Ministry would be all over all who sell secretly or in public any pieces of weapons. The Ministry will never allow the death trade to appear again after we took an unprecedented step to eliminate this distressing way to make money through death, he added Yemen's efforts at internal control started after 9/11 with the new international focus on terrorism. The Yemeni government embarked upon a widely known weapons buyback program, hoping to neutralize the threat they posed to government control, in a non-confrontational manner. Yemeni authorities have shut down all arms businesses in anticipation of the introduction of a new licensing system in a bid to control the trade in a country with one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world. The Interior Ministry will take on the task of regulating weapons purchases in the country through the official licensing and monitoring of dealers and dealerships. Yemen has an estimated 60 million firearms in private hands, roughly three for every man, woman and child. Gun ownership has long been seen as an essential part of Yemeni culture.
