ArmsDealing Article:  Bangkok Post, April 13, 2008The Bangkok Post interviewed the flight navigator, Raph Plotnitskaia, in Klong Prem prison who refused to answer basic questions about the flights of the Ilyushin, but insisted he was innocent and should be released. The crew  have said they believed they were delivering oil drilling equipment loaded in Pyongyang. ''We should be handed to our country. We can't be charged and detained in Thailand,'' he said before the report on Thursday that charges would likely be dropped.  He did confirm that the flight path was from Kiev to Don Mueang airport.  Plotnitskaia said they were supposed to continue to Colombo, Sri Lanka, the UAE and the finally to Kiev where the cargo was to be delivered. ''I saw the crates on the plane but didn't open them as they were sealed with proper documents as oil drilling equipment. I didn't open the crates. Why should I? I am just a navigator.'' he said.
