US GOVERNMENT TELEPHONE INTERCEPT: In Russian, from an Internet Café in Moscow to a location in Yemen, 9 March 2009.Translated from Russian, the receiver of the phone call is identified as Saleh Ahmed.“The farming equipment can go to Sana’a.” “Brother Aden is a hard worker.” “But he will not attend the reunion.  You must join us to celebrate.” “Yes. Of course.  I will greet you most warmly at the Burj on 19 April, but brother Haik has had unfortunate circumstances and will only be there for Monday. Will I have the honor to meet Nicolai?” (The signal is lost at this point.)It is believed “Burj” refers to the Burj Al Arab hotel, a “seven star” super luxury hotel in Dubai.
