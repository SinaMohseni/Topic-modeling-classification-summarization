Report Date:  18 April 2009 from Kenya Society and Politics, a blogKenya has been named in a report by a Swedish research institute as the middleman for many shipments of weapons to Southern Sudan government forces in violation of a peace agreement that has the full support of the United States.The Sudan Human Well-Being and Security Assessment, which is a multi-year research project administered by the Guns and Ammunitions Survey - an independent research project of the Graduate School for Global and Development Studies - reported that satellite imagery has confirmed the presence at Southern Sudan military headquarters of multiple rocket launcher vehicles that arrived at the port of Mombasa in 2008.These TOS-1s were part of three weapons shipments from Ukraine "ostensibly consigned to the Kenyan Ministry of Defence" but that were in fact under contract to the Government of Southern Sudan, according to the Guns and Ammunitions Survey. In addition to multiple rocket launcher vehicles, the three shipments in 2007 and 2008 are said to include 14.5 mm machine guns, 23 mm anti-aircraft cannon, RPG-7 rocket launchers and AKM assault rifles.Some of these arms transfers to South Sudan forces were facilitated by a Nairobi-based shipping agency run by a British national, the survey says. It does not name the agency.
