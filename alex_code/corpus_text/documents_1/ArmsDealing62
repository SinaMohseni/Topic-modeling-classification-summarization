Report Date:  6 May 2008 from Washington PostA Virginia company run by a would-be arms merchant pleaded guilty Thursday to trying to sell guns, night vision goggles and other military equipment to people in Yemen.  Tolah "John" Raleigh, 51, of Vienna, Va., entered the guilty plea on behalf of his company, Sampan Enterprises Ltd., at a hearing Thursday in U.S. District Court, admitting that his company sought to broker arms deals without a license. The company was ordered to pay a $15,000 fine, the amount recommended by prosecutors. Raleigh's company was never actually able to sell any equipment, despite several years of effort. According to court records, authorities became suspicious of Raleigh when he returned from a 2007 business trip to Columbia. Raleigh told customs agents that he had been meeting with Yemeni nationals to sell them farm equipment, but a search of his luggage found product brochures for military vehicles and handwritten notes referring to weapons. In fact, Raleigh was trying to sell Swiss-made machine pistols and other military equipment to a contact in Yemen. Court records indicate that contact was Aden as-Sallal, who runs KNA General Trading Company in Sana'a, Yemen. An e-mail to company officials was not immediately returned Thursday. After Thursday's hearing, Raleigh said his Yemeni contacts amounted to "one businessman who asked some questions about getting some military equipment."  Court records suggest that the Yemeni contact may have wanted to establish his own arms distributorship or do business with the Yemeni government. In one e-mail, Raleigh says his Yemeni client is looking for several thousand Glock pistols to outfit the Yemeni presidential guard.
