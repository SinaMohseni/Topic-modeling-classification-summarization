Report Date:  27 September 2008 from Kenya Society and Politics, a blogOur investigations show that the movement of firearms and ammunition from MP armoury — if indeed that is the origin of the weapons — was done with the knowledge of senior staff at the Ministry Police Training College (MPTC).Our sources note "The system is foolproof and what happened is a result of negligence or was deliberate to frustrate transfers or discredit colleagues.”"The consignment from the Police Ordinance Factory is signed by the commandant and countersigned by the force armourer, who each keep copies of all paperwork coming and going. And we can provide positive proof on how the system works and how we track how weapons and equipment are handled," says the source.Force commandant, chief armourer, and chief of operations are responsible for acquiring arms. These are the officers Parliamentary Committee are most interested in if the ongoing inquiries would not resolve the riddle.It also came to light that two weeks before the discovery of the illegal arsenal, 1,400 MP officers had been training in Ngong, about 60km from Narok, in preparation for security operations in western Kenya. If that were the case, they said, close to 500 guns are yet to be accounted for.The officers who took part in training are currently involved in security operations in Mt Elgon to dispel banditry that has over the past three months claimed more than 120 lives."Impossible.  Such a large amount of munitions and arms could not have left the  armoury without the knowledge of the commandant. In any case, our records are updated daily," he adds.In a fiery exchange in Parliament on Thursday, MPs examined the confusing arrests of senior officers, with Public Accounts Committee chairman Mwaka Omondi, calling for indictment of the top brass. There is also news of a suspicious attempt to influence police investigators with offers of Sh3 million, which they rejected.
