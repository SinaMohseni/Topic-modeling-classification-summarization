ArmsDealing Article:  Bangkok Post, March 2, 2008Thai authorities seized an Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft carrying tons of weapons from North Korea during a refueling stop in Bangkok, a government official said. The pilot told Thai authorities the aircraft was headed to Sri Lanka, but its final destination was unknown, according to a spokesman for the Thai prime minister. It contained about 35 tons of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-launched rockets and tubes that may be missile components, the spokesman said. The plane, which was detained Saturday, had five people onboard -- four from Ukraine and one from Belarus. They will appear in court Monday on charges related to illegal weapons smuggling, the spokesman said.
