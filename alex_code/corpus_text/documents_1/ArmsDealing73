Report Date:  23 November 2008  from SABA, Yemen News Agency  San’a’ -- Fighting in northern Yemen has moved into Saudi Arabia, forcing school closures and sending thousands fleeing, according to the United Nations. Fighting has now spilled into Saudi Arabia, reportedly causing 240 villages to be evacuated and more than 50 schools to be closed,  Sigrid Khan of UNICEF said in a statement this week. The total number of people displaced by the conflict since 2004 has gone up to more than 175,000, from an estimated 150,000 only a few weeks ago. Some point fingers at destabilizing foreign influence in the regional affair, directed against the Saudi regime.  Yet, others insist that this is a problem rooted in domestic unrest. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. Al-Houthi founded a new movement called the Sha‘ab al-Muminin (the Young Believers) and acquired significant religious status amongst the Za’idi population of northern Yemen.  But as the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kahn said. During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated. Lack of safe water, nutrition and hygiene is exerting a heavy toll on their health and well-being, and threatening their very survival, Khan said.  Camps for refugees are filled, and those who cannot obtain a place in the camps are collecting just outside. Yemen's official news agency SABA reported Friday it was working to establish new refugees camps, however, this will do little to solve the core problems.
