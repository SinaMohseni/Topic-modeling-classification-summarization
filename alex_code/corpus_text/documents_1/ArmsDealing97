Report Date:  23 September 2008  from everythingAfrica.com, a blog on African society and politicsSeveral members of the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) have been arrested in a security operation in the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya.  Also recovered were 150 guns, 200 uniforms and police clothes, and 500 machetes.  Police spokesman Abasi Gashi said yesterday that the operation has turned out very successfully.  But Gashi also noted that the operation was not complete.  “We will not conclude this operation until the bandits have all been rounded up and routed.”  There are claims of police harassment throughout the region.  Mr. Gakere Wangai says that police has roughed up him and several others that he knows even though they are not associated with SLDF. “They broke into my house and beat me for a long time.  I kept asking them why, but they would not stop hitting me.”  A pastor who lives in the same area, reports a similar story, “I was just taking tea when officers burst in and thrashed me and my guests. I was knocked unconscious until the next day.”  Journalists have not been allowed into the operations area, and are treated roughly by security forces.  Gashi denies that the media, or anyone else, have been harassed.
