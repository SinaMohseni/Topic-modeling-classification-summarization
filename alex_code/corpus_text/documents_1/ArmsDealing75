Report Date:  27 September 2008 from The East African Standard, Nairobi  A member of a Parliamentary Committee on Security told The Standard on Sunday the House team would want to question some of the force’s top command. The member said information his colleagues had gathered over the cache, pointed to a deal gone awry. The claim is corroborated by Internal Security Assistant Minister Jimiyu Michieka who told The Standard on Sunday the seizure of the weapons was exposed following a deal gone sour among the merchants of death, said to include civilians and security officers. Some senior officers at the Ministry Police Training College (MPTC) interviewed point to unresolved political intrigues that relate to the retention of Ita Adoyo who should have retired last year. An inspector, who cannot be named for fear of reprisals, claims it was unusual for items to leave the armoury without the knowledge of senior officers. Even more intriguing are revelations that the force’s firearms and ammunitions records are updated daily. Requisitions from districts and units — MPTC, Security of Government Buildings, Rapid Deployment Unit and Rural Border Patrol Unit — are approved by the Force Commandant. He should be the one answering the questions about how arms ended in civilian custody as claimed, the source said.Arms acquisition, it also emerged, is steeped in corruption. What raises more questions is that the armoury is under CCTV surveillance and armed guard round the clock. Asked about how this is feasible, Michieka  said, This is a sensitive matter. I am not privy to information about how the force keeps its records or secures the armoury. From the look of things this is just a deal gone sour.
