REPORT DATE:    23 January 2008 [provided to CIA by Pakistani Criminal Investigation Unit, Lahore Division]Sixty National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) blanks were stolen from a Ministry of Interior office in Lahore on 4 January 2008.  A suspect, Kashif Inshan Ali, was apprehended within 24 hours at his apartment in the Heera Mandi district of Lahore.  Ali, who is known to the CID to have frequent involvement in theft and handling (the resale of stolen property), denies involvement despite being confronted with CCTV footage showing him entering the Ministry building after closing.  Jhangvi’s name appeared on a list found on a computer hard drive in Ali’s Lahore apartment.  All but 17 of the blanks were recovered in a trash bin outside Ali’s apartment building.  It appears an attempt had been made to destroy them through burning.   Jhangvi denied involvement.  No charges were filed; Jhangvi was released the same day.
