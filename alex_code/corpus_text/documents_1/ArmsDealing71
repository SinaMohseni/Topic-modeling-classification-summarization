News Article:  Bangkok Post, March 17, 2009  According to a report Thailand submitted over the weekend to the U.N., the company that shipped the weapons found on the Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane seized in Bangkok last year was the Korea Machinery Industry Co., and the cache included 49 rockets, a rocket launcher and three crates of fuses and rocket-propelled grenades. North Korean sales of missiles, missile parts and other arms to countries such as Iran, Syria and Myanmar are believed to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to North Korea's hard-currency earnings. Although the sale of such relatively routine weapons would normally not be illegal, in this case it violates the ban imposed under a U.N. resolution designed to punish North Korea after it consistently violated UN-imposed sanctions over the past year. Thailand has asked the U.N. Security Council how to handle and dispose of the weapons, advice that has not so far been forthcoming.
