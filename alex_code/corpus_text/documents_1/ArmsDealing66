Report Date:  26 September 2008 from The East African Standard, NairobiHardly a week after the Cabinet approved police reforms the Ministry Police (MP) is in the eye of a new storm over an illegal arms haul.The force, which has been adversely mentioned in various reports that accuse it of gross human rights violations that include murder and rape during and after the 2007 General Election is fending off allegations that its top brass is involved in clandestine movement of arms.The centre of the new storm is force commandant Ita Adoyo, who last week some MPs wanted grilled.Focus shifted to Adoyo following a cache of arms allegedly found in Narok. It is believed the incident may be linked to succession battles in the MP hierarchy.The battle is becoming even more intense as MP Commandant Ita Adoyo’s tenure end on March 30, next year. The circumstances also reflect the lapses and connivance that are a threat to national security. Security experts and sources familiar with force’s register of arms claim the incident was deliberate."There was some deal-making between some officers. The seizure of the arms and ammunitions, it appears, was pre-arranged," the security expert familiar with on-going criminal investigations said.It is claimed senior officers in the force are on high alert over information that could implicate them because they would most likely take responsibility if the arms originated there.
