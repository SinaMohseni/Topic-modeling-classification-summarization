ArmsDealing Article:  Bangkok Post, March 3, 2008 The tale of the cargo plane that landed in Bangkok from North Korea becomes an increasing mystery.  The Bangkok Post visited Ebina House hotel and interviewed two staff who confirmed from photos that the five man crew of the plane had stayed there. ''They arrived here in late afternoon on Feb 11 accompanied by about 10 Thai men who appeared like their bodyguards,'' said one of the staff. 'One of them booked five suites, paying 3,500 baht for each, on the 9th floor. Most of the Thais remained in the lobby and around the hotel all night. They departed with the foreigners around 9am the following day. I saw the five men on television and in newspapers later on.''Questions were raised about why a plane carrying 35 tonnes of weapons allegedly from North Korea, in breach of UN sanctions, would stop to refuel in Bangkok when there are safer regional stopover destinations for arms smugglers such as Burma, Laos and Vietnam.  The circuitous 24,000 km route, with the alleged final destination Iran, also did not make sense for several diplomats who said the weapons could be easily sourced from former Soviet countries.
