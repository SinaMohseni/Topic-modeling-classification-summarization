Report Date:   January 15, 2009  from the Daily TelegraphA Kenyan court has acquitted Wanjohi Onyango, Thabiti Otieno and wife Nahid Owiti of illegal possession and smuggling of arms and ammunition.  The three were released on Monday after judges decided there was insufficient evidence against them, in light of the national government’s internal investigations into illegal arms deals involving the Ministry Police.   The three defendants’ eight-year jail sentence for was set aside by the court. A lower court had earlier convicted them of possessing government arms and selling them to foreign interests. According to the appellate court, much of the witness testimony was not credible because it was unclear on dates, locations and often contained elements that could be "objectively proven to be impossible". The court ruled that a conviction on such evidence would be "built on quicksand". The ruling is a blow for prosecutors who had appealed for a stiffer sentence and sought an additional conviction for war crimes for the three defendants.  Kenyan Internal Security Assistant Minister Jimiyu Michieka did not immediately return calls for a statement concerning the outcome of this trial.
