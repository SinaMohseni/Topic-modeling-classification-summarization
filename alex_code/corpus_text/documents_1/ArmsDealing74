Report Date:   October 17, 2008 from The East African Standard, Nairobi  The Kenyan working at a British Army base, Mr. Thabiti Otieno, who was arrested and detained in connection with the huge cache of weapons seized by police in Narok, has indeed been getting government tenders to supply materiel to the government.  But Narok North District procurement officer Chilemba Abasi quickly added that he was not the only beneficiary and that the bidding was competitive and lawful. In court, Mr Onyango, Mr Otieno and his wife Nahid Owiti, will Friday know whether they will be released on bail. They have all pleaded not guilty to the charges. In Parliament, Mr Omondi said that six people from a Ministry Police camp were being questioned over the arms cache. Mr Omondi issued a ministerial statement as members said suspicion was high that the MP armoury had been raided.  We want to know who issued and received the arms within the department of the MP and we want to know for what purpose this was done, he said. He also sought to know what was being done to the commander who gives authority for movement of armours from the armoury.  I will be updating Kenyans on findings because this is a serious and sensitive matter, he promised.
