Report Date:  23 March 2009 from Kenya Society and Politics, a blogA plane from South Africa  carrying US$3.2M dropped the demanded ransom onto M/V Tanya upon an agreement between the pirates and the ship's owner.The pirates said they will release M/V Tanya in a few hours, as soon as they count the sum and confirm there are no warships to hunt them.The news comes after the Dutch owner of the vessel had earlier refused to hold talks with the bandits, who had repeatedly threatened the lives of the crew members unless they were paid a multi-million ransom.The capture of the arms-laden ship five months ago triggered a controversy over the cargo's final destination.The pirates' spokesman said in Oct. 2008 that M/V Tanya was originally destined for the Kenyan port city of Mombasa. Later, the pirates changed their story and insisted that the arms were destined for Sudan.As we have said from the beginning -- the most interesting part of this may be what becomes of M/V Tanya after the release -- as the world watches.
