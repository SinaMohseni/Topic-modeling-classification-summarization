REPORT DATE:    23 January 2008 [news report from International Tribune]Sitting in a sunny corner of the sidewalk café in Beirut, Muhammad Kasem notes each person who passes, watching for any signs that Kasem should make a quick exit.“I was captured once because I didn’t pay attention,” he tells me as he taps his cigarette over his knee and ashes the ground.  “This won’t happen again.  I’m very careful.  I watch everything, I take every precaution.”Why is Kasem worried? “Being the second most wanted man around will do that,” he chuckles. The Martyrs Front of Judea is dedicated to regaining a foothold in the Gaza/West Bank area currently under dispute with Israel.  As recent as last month there was an explosion in an open-air market in the West Bank.  Four people were injured, including a security officer.Kasem inherited his position as leader of the MFJ when the former leader, Ibrahim Bahlan, was killed in an attack at the MFJ headquarters in May 2007.  Since then he’s reorganized the group and worked to bring their message to the forefront of the media.  And he’s keeping the location of the headquarters secret.“We don’t want to be vulnerable, but it’s hard to conduct a campaign from behind shrubbery,” Kasem states.  “It’s hard to set up a supply chain without a stable address.”But it isn’t hard to find recruits, he points out.  “I don’t have to advertise; whenever we’re attacked we have people looking to join our cause.  The people know justice and righteousness when they see it.”How does he deal with his supply problem?“You know I can’t tell you about that,” he grins.  “But I will say we have contacts and suppliers spanning four countries.  And we have the best arms available.  Our enemy should be very scared.”As the sun sets, Kasem finishes his tea and stubs out his cigarette.“Watch for us.  We have big plans on the horizon.”And after scanning the street once last time, Kasem melts into the crowd.
