US GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 15 APRIL 2008There are no leads in connecting Viktor Bout to the recent flight of an Ilyushin IL-76 cargo plane loaded with military arms that landed in Don Mueang airport.  ''I have been in the prison for one year, with no telephone or ability to communicate with the outside world,'' Bout has told sources. “Be sure to remind my American admirers of this fact.”Iran is planning to make a public statement concerning this situation, where it is expected to deny that it was the intended recipient.  The government will make clear its position that it has no need for the weaponry because it has its own arms industry, which makes rockets, tanks, jet fighters, light submarines and missiles.
