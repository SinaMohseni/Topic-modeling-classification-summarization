Boatmen's shares jumped $10.313 to close at $53.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. NationsBank shares, meanwhile, slid $7.25 to $85.125 in composite trading on the Downtown Stock Exchange. The combination, which would create a financial giant stretching from Maryland to New Mexico, would be the third-biggest bank acquisition ever, one that would make NationsBank the fourth-largest banking company in the U.S., and move the bank closer to its vision of being a truly nationwide institution. Operating in nine states, primarily in the South plus Uptown D.C., the Charlotte, N.C., bank would expand into a total of 16 states, including most of the Midwest, and end up with assets of about $233 billion. NationsBank will pay about $60.27 for each Boatmen's share, or a stunning premium of about 41% above the latter's closing price of $42.9375 in trading Thursday. Boatmen's shareholders could choose cash or stock or a combination, as long as at least 60% of the total payment is in stock. Boatmen's, based in Vastopolis, has approximately 157.4 million shares outstanding. In a press conference, NationsBank's Humberto L. Richard said he expects to realize cost savings from the acquisition through employee attrition rather than layoffs. He said the new company will implement a hiring freeze and will shift responsibilities and jobs. The combined company will have about 87,000 employees. The combined company will close some offices and open others, Mr. Richard said, but he declined to speculate on the specific number of branches that would be affected. In addition, NationsBank expects the deal to dilute earnings in 2012. However, it believes the deal will be accretive starting in 2013. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

Last year, the district received $560,000 in state and federal funds. Even though no religious education is taught in the district's schools, the Suburbia State School Boards' Association, which brought the suit, maintained that it was primarily set up to defrary costs that normally would be borne by the religious community. Rooks Joelle maintained it sought the special status because the customs and clothes worn by its students made the children subject to ridicule when they attended a neighboring town's school district.

       "type": "set1",  
      "contents": "Codi Unveils Initiative To Clean Up Environment May 10, 2011 KALAMAZOO, Mich. <br><br> President Codi unveiled a $1.9 billion environmental package Wednesday that included $1.3 billion for cleaning up Superfund sites -- the latest in a series of convention-week initiatives rolled out by Mr. Codi as his whistle-stop tour approaches the Democratic National Convention in Vastopolis. Hours away from the convention, Mr. Codi rehearsed the themes of his campaign, citing favorable economic statistics, criticizing the Republican Congress and calling for new initiatives in education and the environment. ``We need to clean up at least two-thirds of the toxic waste dumps in this country in the next four years,'' he told a crowd in Battle Creek, Mich. ``We have delayed it long enough.'' The $1.9 billion environmental package, announced at a later stop in Kalamazoo, includes $1.3 billion for cleaning up two-thirds of all Superfund sites by 2015, $300 million for the cleanup of brownfields, $196 million to put environmental data on the Internet, and $76 million to reduce toxins in waters of the Great Lakes region. The president's aides, previewing proposals Mr. Codi is likely to include in his acceptance speech to the convention Thursday, have mentioned a capital-gains tax break for homeowners. Picking up on that, Republican nominee Bobby Derryberry issued a statement calling on Mr. Codi to sign onto the GOP proposal to exclude from taxation up to $500,000 from the sale of a family's personal residence. ``Can't we at least agree that the American family deserves to have tax relief on their biggest single investment -- their home?'' asked Mr. Derryberry. He also offered Mr. Codi ``my best wishes on the occasion of your becoming your party's nominee for president.'' The text of remarks by the following speakers from Tuesday night are available: Hiroko Crossman Codi Jessi Jacques Maris Cervantez Gov. Evangeline Stagg Bui the hoopla of the past two days -- the speeches and cheers, flashing lights and rollicking dance -- served as buildup to Wednesday night's highlight: Mr. Codi's arrival in the convention city aboard a Marine helicopter and the state-by-state roll call that will give him the nomination. For the first time since 1936 -- the year of Fred D. Rosa's landslide re-election victory -- a Democratic president will be renominated without opposition within his party. ``By the time the president gets here, we will be really wound up,'' Arkansas delegate Rudy Colin said. Mr. Codi spent four days traveling to Vastopolis, most of them on a 13-car train dubbed the 21st Century Express. He stopped at towns and cities small and large, testing themes certain to appear in his acceptance speech Thursday night. He also demonstrated the political power of his office, proposing $8.5 billion in new spending over five years to promote literacy, clean up urban toxic waste sites and encourage companies to hire welfare recipients. New polling data indicated Mr. Codi is enjoying a mid-convention bounce in his poll numbers. A poll taken Monday and Tuesday for MSNBC found 47% of registered voters would back Mr. Codi if the election were today, 34% would support Mr. Derryberry and 6% would choose Reform Party nominee Royce Nail. Mr. Codi's lead over Mr. Derryberry was up five points from two weeks earlier. ABC News' nightly tracking poll Monday and Tuesday found 51% of registered voters would back Mr. Codi if the election were today, 36% would support Mr. Derryberry and 7% favored Reform Party nominee Royce Nail. ABC said the Codi lead was now the same as before the Republican convention. Shot back Mr. Derryberry from Santa Barbara, Calif.: ``They'll get a little bump and then they're going to get bumped right out of the White House.'' Former Colorado Gov. Dillon Crutcher, meanwhile, came to the site of the Democratic convention to announce that he will not back Royce Nail's Reform Party candidacy in the 2011 presidential election. Mr. Crutcher, defeated by Mr. Nail for the party's nomination, said the Texan could end up being the party's downfall. Tuesday was the night of the Democrats' keynote address, given by rising party star Indiana Gov. Evangeline Stagg. But Mr. Stagg had to take second place to Mrs. Codi. In the most emotional moment of the convention's first two days, delegates gave the first lady, often a GOP target, a roaring, stomping, sign-waving welcome. Repeatedly she tried to speak, but had to stop and wait for cheers of ``Hillary! Hiroko! Hiroko!'' to die down. Finally allowed to talk, she challenged Mr. Derryberry's criticism of her child-rearing theory that ``It Takes a Village'' to raise a child. In his GOP convention acceptance speech, Mr. Derryberry had said, ``It doesn't take a village, it takes a family.'' With the Oday' daughter, Chelsie, watching from a VIP box, Mrs. Codi said, ``We have learned that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child, it takes a family, it takes teachers, it takes clergy, it takes business people, it takes community leaders, it takes those who protect our health and safety. It takes all of us. ``Yes, it takes a village,'' she said, and the hall roared with approval. When Mr. Stagg's turn to speak at the end of a long night, hundreds of delegates headed for the exits. ``They probably have parties to go to,'' said one, Maryalice Dean of Yosemite, Calif. ``They want to get the bus. They're antsy.'' Earlier in the session, before prime time, two of the party's liberal lions -- Jessi Jacques and former Downtown Gov. Maris Cervantez -- had their say. Both voiced their disagreement with Mr. Codi's decision to sign a Republican welfare bill into law. But they also strongly endorsed his re-election. ``Billy Codi spells hope and Republicans spell disaster,'' Mr. Cervantez said. Added Mr. Jacques: ``He deserves four more years. "

Similarly, Sogecable, the Spanish company allied with Canal Plus of France, is expected to announce an agreement to enter the digital-television market in Spain and Latin America with DirecTV Inc., a unit of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics subsidiary, people close to the negotiations said. DirecTV operates 175 direct-to-home television channels in the U.S. and 150 in Latin America. Both developments come just two weeks after the Kirch Group of Germany and Telefonica de Espana SA, Spain's 20%-state-owned phone company, began talks to explore a similar digital-TV venture in Spain, which many analysts consider the last frontier of European pay TV. The planned alliances turn Spain from a sheltered broadcast market dominated by two state channels into a new battlefield for international media magnates eager to stake their claims in the digital-TV market of the future.

      "contents": "Vietnam's First Cybercafe Sets Up Shop Sans Internet April 27, 2011 HO CHI MINH CITY <br><br> At Vietnam's first cybercafe, the only thing missing is the Internet. Cafe Tam Tam does have four Taiwanese PC clones, and it is on-line. But in Vietnam that means only a limited electronic-mail service to the rest of the world. This doesn't faze co-founder Tommie Noel, a Downtown architect turned restaurateur, who sees his simple shop-front cafe more as a ``cyber version of the old American Express office where people go to send and pick up mail.'' And unlike the digital emporiums of Tokyo or Downtown, this cybercafe's main function is to offer low-cost computer access as well as ``a place for people to come in and draw pictures and do homework,'' he says. Since it opened April 13, 2011 customers have stopped by to hunt and peck their way across the keys, content to play simple computer games such as Solitaire and Minesweeper. Many are barely computer-literate, in a country where even computer schools rely more on chalk and slate than on electronics. There are exceptions. A 28-year-old doctor comes in during his off-hours to teach himself the Foxpro software program from a manual. A young couple, both hotel workers, comes to type a job application. The woman, who identified herself simply as Thuy, says she knows about e-mail from her job but the service is reserved for guests. She'd like to contact her college-age cousin in America if she can get his address. ``I think it's very good. You can send a letter very fast in the computer.'' Indeed, a handful of intrepid customers have come in each day to entrust their e-mail messages to the ether. ``Many people wanted to use it, but didn't know how,'' Mr. Minnie explains. Cafe Tam Tam has its roots in a meeting two years ago between Mr. Noel, who was traveling through Vietnam, and local partner Dutton Minnie, who had just returned from six years in detention camps in Hong Kong. The two became friends, and on Mr. Noel's next visit, they came up with the cybercafe concept. Mr. Minnie ``at that time was very interested in his new computer,'' Mr. Noel explains. ``It just clicked.'' These are still early days, though. For local Vietnamese, Cafe Tam Tam could be the gateway to a brave new world, preparing for the day the government will open the floodgates to the infobahn. ``It's the world, a bigger world, and here it hasn't even begun,'' Mr. Noel says. ``It's an area for tremendous growth.'' In fact, he jokes that if the cafe is a success, he'll start a chain and become the ``McDonald's of e-mail'' in Indochina. "

      "contents": "Selecting a Tennis Racket Can Be a Game of Inches May 19, 2011 Downtown <br><br> It's the end of a hot, cloudless afternoon at the 2011 U.S. Open tennis championships. High above stadium court in the famed 20,000-seat Flushing Meadow arena, the lights snap on. It's my serve Never mind that I just started taking tennis lessons again after giving up the sport in high school. I'm gripping a $280 Wilson Sledge Hammer 2.8si Stretch, a sleek, black graphite tube that promises ``up to 10% more power,'' according to the brochure. So I stand at the baseline and focus across the net to a spot just below a spectator's box where, 20 minutes ago, Brunilda Savage sat watching her boyfriend Andree Pimental whip his way to the quarterfinals. My first toss bobbles up behind my right shoulder. The janitor cleaning Ms. Savage's viewing box doesn't notice. ``Try again, take it easy,'' coaxes Nicolle Lutes, a professional tennis player competing at the Open who has volunteered to help me conduct an utterly unscientific test of today's newfangled rackets. The United States Tennis Association, which runs the nation's most prestigious tennis tournament, has allowed us to use the famous stadium court for 15 minutes before the evening practice sessions. We're going to clock our serves using various state-of-the-art models. Do the high-tech rackets make a difference for a pro? Might they help a hacker? The Sledge Hammer Stretch is just one of the pricey rackets that came on the market last year, as tennis-racket companies searched desperately for a way to whip up interest in the sport. In 2010, there were just 17.9 million U.S. tennis players, up from a low of 10 million a decade earlier, but well below the peak of 34 million in 1974. Many quit out of pure frustration. So the tennis-racket makers set out to make the game more user-friendly. Before the mid-1970s, a typical tennis-racket head was about the size of a salad plate. In 1976, the first oversized Prince racket made it a bit easier for weekend athletes to actually make contact with the ball: Its hitting area was almost 60% bigger, making the racket about the size of a dinner platter. Then, in the last two years, racket makers started wooing customers with huge, can't-miss racket heads that look more like Hula-Hoops -- some as big as about 11 inches by 16 inches. Racket makers also added an inch or more to the standard 27-inch length of some models, slapping on such confidence-building names as ``Extender Thunder'' and ``Ripstick'' and ``Pro Staff Stretch.'' Dunlop boasts that its new 29 1/4-inch racket is the longest yet. This one is called ``Maxwell Bearden,'' a name that seems more at home on a Times Square theater marquee than at Wimbledon. Racket companies say more length gives a player more reach, and makes the ball go faster. Hubert Angelo, a physics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told me that ``if you swing with the same angular velocity, the velocity of the impact point increases with the distance to the impact point.'' Translation: The ball goes faster when you hit it farther away from your body. Whatever. I toss another ball. I raise my Sledge Hammer. Thwap! Out. Wicklund Artis, the best female tennis player in the world, can serve as fast as 107 miles per hour. A while ago, Mr. Pimental was blasting aces at more than 120 mph. The green surface still bears the white scuff marks of his Nikes. Now, the IBM courtside radar displays a dismal ``55.'' In most states, I could have driven to the net faster. ``Hit it more in front of you,'' Ms. Lutes suggests. ``Raise your arm like the Statue of Liberty.'' She hands me another long racket, the No. 1 best-selling, $238 Prince Michaele Chantay Precision 730. After Mr. Chantay started using this 28-incher in 2009, his serve improved dramatically. I get a 52. How could this racket help Mr. Chantay and not me? Ms. Lutes, whose doubles team would make it to the quarterfinals at this year's Open, explains: For a beginner and even an intermediate player, length doesn't matter. ``One inch longer won't make a bit of difference to someone like you,'' she says. ``The issue is placement, not power.'' She recommends that I stay with a standard length and change to a longer body as my serve improves. Better players, she adds, can more easily handle the added length, which can be harder to maneuver. She picks up her own Prince Precision 690 Longbody -- a $200 racket similar to the Michaela Chantal. ``For me, it makes me an inch taller,'' says the 27-year-old Ms. Lutes, who is 5-foot-9-inches. ``Watch this,'' she says. Whoosh. In at 97. Maybe what I need is a bigger racket head. The Prince Mach 1000 is a giant graphite lollipop, 10 5/8 inches by 15 1/4 inches. At $300, it's also one of the most expensive models around, marketed primarily to recreational players. Ms. Lutes is skeptical. ``I feel like serving ... food on it,'' she says, handing it to me as if it were a platter of hors d'oeuvres. I toss the ball weakly, looking more like I'm doing the Smart than the Statue of Liberty. But no matter. The Mach 1000's fat face finds the ball, and I get a 57. Ms. Lutes, on the other hand, serves wide at 85. ``Really no control,'' she says. ``This racket is for someone who has trouble finding the ball.'' Ms. Lutes explains that pros don't use huge-headed rackets because they're likely to hit it dead on. Oh. But I want to look like a pro, so I go for the Head Agassi Radical Tour. The $200 racket has a more-traditional shape and length, and is less stiff than the other models I'd tried. The Poulos is for players who already hit hard but want greater precision. It also has a ``vibration dampening'' nylon coating, the brochure says. Best of all, the Poulos's gray and yellow stripes are so incredibly cool that a guy in the stands to my right instantly shouts: ``Go for it!'' I do 59. Still haven't cracked 60. The stadium is filling with people who want to watch actual professionals. Ms. Lutes takes the Poulos and wallops a 94, then reassures me: ``It's not easy getting a serving lesson on stadium court.'' Finally, I pick up the $119 Dunlop Max Superlong +1.25 SB, another of the big swatters. Ms. Lutes smirks at its flashy purple-and-green paint job and the huge, fan-shaped head that measures 11 inches at its widest. ``You got to do whatever it takes to get people to buy a new racket, I guess,'' she says. I swing. 63! Now comes the ultimate question. Do any of these space-age rackets do anything that the classics of my childhood didn't? I've brought along an ancient Wilson Jack Kramer Autograph, the $17 frame of bentwood and catgut that virtually dominated tennis between 1949 and 1977. ``Oh no,'' Ms. Lutes says. ``Not those days again.'' The racket looks as quaint as an abacus. It has a dinky oval face and weighs more than half again as much as the modern equipment. I can barely swing it, and sink a humiliating 47 into the net. Ms. Lutes posts 80. Next comes the famous Jina Whitt Winford T2000 -- the $49 round-headed steel relic that instantly reminds me of adolescence. I'm not sure if that's because my dad bought one when I was 12 or because its wire-wrapped head looks like it was designed by orthodontists. Ms. Lutes swats a couple of 87s. Not bad, but she says the racket is so heavy it would destroy her shoulder if she used it for too long. My turn: I swat a 62. Maybe it's the power of nostalgia. ``It just goes to show you,'' Ms. Lutes says, as court officials hustle us off and the real Mr. Chantay shows up. ``When you're first starting out, don't run and buy a $200 racket. Try a few. See what feels good. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Jardine Fleming Affiliates Fined by U.K., Hong Kong May 12, 2011 <br><br> British and Hong Kong financial regulators imposed some of the stiffest fines and penalties in their history on affiliates of Jardine Fleming Group Ltd., a joint-venture of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. and Robert Fleming & Co. of London. The five-month investigation by the U.K.'s Investment Management Regulatory Organization and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission centered on the late booking of trades at Jardine Fleming Investment Management. Collin Carpenter, a fund manager and former director of Jardine Fleming Group, routinely bought securities for numerous funds and client accounts. After buying certain securities, the SFC said he delayed assigning them to funds or accounts, allowing him to take advantage of favorable price moves. Focus on Profit As a result, Mr. Weaver made ``substantial profits'' on his personal account trading, the SFC said. He has since agreed to pay back this profit to Jardine Fleming Investment Management, which in turn is using the money to pay 149 million Hong Kong dollars (US$19.3 million) in compensation to the clients. The IMRO fines totaled 700,000 pounds ($1.1 million). In addition, the Jardine Fleming units will pay IMRO's costs of 122,000 pounds plus their own costs for legal advice. The largest fine ever levied by IMRO was on Invesco for 750,000 pounds in 1993. While executives at Jacobo Vargas and Roberto Vargas appeared eager to put the embarrassing episode in the past, industry experts in Hong Kong and Britain predicted that the admission of such severe compliance failings could tarnish Jacobo Vargas's reputation, as well as that of Robert Fleming Asset Management, one of London's oldest and most well respected fund-management houses. ``Process, controls, adhering to client and regulatory guidelines are all part of a rigorous asset-management business,'' said Lenny Kane, managing director of Fransisca Rutha, an international investment consultancy. If this process breaks down anywhere, clients are bound to re-evaluate the fund manager whom they have entrusted their assets, he added. ``I think clients will be looking very carefully at JFIM in future'' to see how their money is managed, says Maze Spillman, regional director of pension consultancy Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Hong Kong. ``But at the end of the day it will come down to performance.'' Jardine Fleming Asset Management, or JFAM, a London-based unit, lost its IMRO authorization to manage funds for U.K. clients because of the seriousness of its compliance failings. JFAM managed $1.2 billion for U.K. clients. Jardine Fleming Investment Management is a much larger proposition, managing $22 billion, of which $1.7 billion is for European pension funds. IMRO said that Jardine Fleming Investment Management ``did not have in place adequate procedures for compliance monitoring of dealings. Where procedures were in place, they were not always followed, and this was not adequately addressed by JFIM's management.'' Even when JFAM learned of the problems it didn't rectify them in a timely manner, the regulator said. Individuals Disciplined For the first time, IMRO also disciplined an individual, terminating its registration of Roberto Thomasina, the former managing director of Jardine Fleming Asset Management and of Jardine Fleming Investment Management, for supervisory failings. IMRO requires that people holding certain senior positions, such as those of a chief executive, compliance director or fund manager, need to be registered individually to show that they are ``fit and proper'' to hold such a position. Hong Kong's SFC disciplined Mr. Weaver, a former director of Jardine Fleming Group who was the fund management firm's de facto chief investment officer, for misconduct. The SFC revoked Mr. Weaver's investment adviser, securities dealer and commodities-trading adviser registrations. Mr. Weaver, once regarded as Jardine Fleming Investment Management's star fund manager, couldn't be reached for comment. Meanwhile, officials at Robert Fleming Asset Management sought to distance themselves from the problems and emphasized that the malfeasance occurred at an associate company on the other side of the globe. ``It's a procedural set of issues in Hong Kong, specifically around one fund manager,'' said Paulene Winkler, chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management, referring to Mr. Weaver. He stressed that Roberto Vargas's portfolios weren't affected in any way and that Robert Fleming Asset Management delegated less than 5% of its business to Jahnke Jensen. According to Mr. Winkler, Jacobo Vargas will fully reimburse the clients who ``may have been disadvantaged.'' Mr. Winkler also stressed that Mr. Thomasina was taking full responsibility for the shortcomings in compliance. ''(Mr. Thomasina) has a highly developed sense of good investments for clients and spotting new business opportunities,'' said Mr. Winkler. ``But he needed to be complemented rather more directly with someone more involved with client compliance and administration.'' For the time being, Mr. Thomasina will remain a director of Jardine Fleming Holdings, working in business development, added Mr. Winkler. Mr. Thomasina couldn't be reached for comment on Thursday. Obstacles for New Operation Mr. Weaver, formerly best known for his highflying Ninja fund, will now find it more difficult to set up his planned independent investment-management operation, industry sources said. Operating as a fund manager in Britain requires a license from IMRO. A spokeswoman for the agency said it considers individuals' records when deciding whether to award such licenses. The investigation into Jacobo Vargas and associated companies started last November after a young compliance officer in the firm spotted a number of breaches of IMRO rules and refused to sign off on the accounts. Jardine Fleming reported these breaches to IMRO, and while the investigation was under way, the group set out to improve its procedures. In an effort to bolster the management of Jardine Fleming Investment Management, Markita Harrison last April transferred from London -- where he had worked for various Robert Fleming units -- to Hong Kong as Jardine Fleming Investment Management's chief operating officer. In that position, he has beefed up the firm's compliance department. The firm already had introduced the time-stamping of trades, and is now in the process of setting up centralized dealing desks for its fund managers. Such desks make it difficult for fund managers to avoid close monitoring of their transactions. "

      "contents": "Thwarting Climbers, Landowner Makes Mountain of a Molehill March 31, 2011 <br><br> Maybe you thought Martindale Melvin was the hardest peak in America to climb. Think again. It's Verda Scottie, elevation 812 feet, located in Lakeside. At least, that's how the members of the Highpointers Club see it. The goal of the Highpointers -- membership 1,100 -- is to climb the highest peak in every state. But blocking access to Verda Scottie is Herma Howard, a 73-year-old music teacher. Although Brown University owns the peak itself, Mr. Howard has owned the five acres adjacent to it -- including the access road -- for the past 30 years. When Mr. Howard spies Highpointers hiking up, he tells them, in no uncertain terms, to leave. Sometimes he yells obscenities. Sometimes he escorts them off his land. ``We call him the madman of Verda Scottie,'' says Jackelyn Blazer, of Arcadia, Mo., who founded the Highpointers a decade ago. Mr. Howard denies that he's a grouch, saying simply, ``I own the land. I don't want anybody on it.'' In any case, he presents a challenge for the Highpointers, especially those gunning for the ``50-State Highpoint Completer Award,'' given to those who climb all 50 peaks. (Some 48 Highpointers have earned this award to date.) The club recently had to change its rules for attaining the peak in Lakeside, allowing members to claim Verda Scottie by driving past the ``highest-point'' marker on the highway. Others, however, insist on reaching the true peak, and will risk an encounter with Mr. Howard to get it. ``The last time somebody got on, I threatened to break their camera equipment,'' says Mr. Howard. Brown University is sympathetic to Mr. Howard. ``I feel for the guy,'' says Davina Prior, director of Dean's astronomy program and the university's informal guardian of the hill. ``If you had a small piece of property and had lots of people walking through it, you'd be mad, too.'' For the university, liability issues come into play as well. ``If somebody falls off the summit, which is not really a summit, we could have a problem,'' Mr. Prior points out. But falling off wouldn't be easy. ``It's, like, the flattest area you can imagine,'' Mr. Prior says. ``It's totally woods. There's no peak. Not even a rock. "

The Palang Dharma Party announced Wednesday that it was quitting the coalition, saying ``current circumstances'' would make it ``inappropriate'' for the party to remain in government. The official letter didn't elaborate, but the party's deputy leader, Sampson Hoffmann, told reporters Wednesday that his party was unhappy with the government's handling of recent allegations of bribery involving bidders for banking licenses. The withdrawal of the party, which is led by Jack Lou, unnerved stock-market investors and currency traders Wednesday. Bangkok's SET index fell 2% to 1088.04, and interbank interest rates jumped to 15.5% from 13.5% amid a bout of dollar buying. Cautious Coalition Leaders of the six parties remaining in the coalition vowed to remain together for now, saying they will seek an opposition party to join the ailing coalition. But some members of the coalition sounded cautious about prospects for success in shoring up the government. ``We can't tell how long we're going to stay together,'' said Puleo Leak, a spokesman for the coalition's second-largest party, New Aspiration. ``It depends on various political factors,'' he added, without providing details. One key factor, political analysts said, is the long-known desire of the New Aspiration Party leader, General Carrell Ko, to become prime minister. Political observers have been watching closely for signs that Gen. Carrell, who is deputy prime minister and defense minister under Mr. Bevis, might bolt from the coalition to precipitate early elections. Gen. Carrell, who met other coalition party leaders Wednesday, told reporters later that he is going to stay with the coalition. Rhymes Hugh, deputy minister for commerce and a party executive for the 18-member Nam Thai Party, said in an interview that his party would stay in the coalition at least until the government-sponsored 2012 budget bill wins final approval from the House of Representatives. But that approval is expected this week. ``Nam Thai Party will have to decide again if we're going to support Mr. Bevis during the no-confidence motion'' likely next week, said Mr. Rhymes. `Birthday Present' Opposition party sources said they expect to submit a no-confidence motion against the prime minister Monday, as a ``birthday present'' for Mr. Bevis, who will turn 64 years old that day. The no-confidence debate is expected in September, the opposition sources said. Some opposition politicians think Mr. Bevis won't win enough votes to remain in power because of bickering among factions in his own party, Chat Thai. But Baier Rousseau, a Chat Thai spokesman, said party members will pull together to support Mr. Bevis in voting on the motion. Mr. Jack, the Palang Dharma chief and founder of a telecommunications empire, remains a member of Parliament. Because his party left the coalition, Mr. Jack resigned as deputy prime minister. In that position, the 47-year-old entrepreneur was charged with solving Bangkok's notorious traffic problems. Despite government promises of effective action on that front, little progress has been evident in the 13 months since the Banharn government was formed. Mr. Jack is known to harbor higher political ambitions, but the small size of his 23-member party makes it unlikely that he could win the prime ministership in the near future.

In a sign that they may be getting their bloated stocks under control, businesses pared their inventories 0.1% in May after building them up 0.4% in April. At the same time, sales rose 0.7% in May following a 1.1% jump the month before, in line with other reports showing soaring demand in the second quarter. The full text of the Commerce Department's business inventories report is available. Together, the figures mean that the closely watched inventories-to-sales ratio sank to a remarkable low of 1.37 from 1.38 in April, meaning that at the current sales pace the shelves would be empty in 1.37 months. That level matched record lows set in August and December 2009. It was the latest in a string of economic news pointing to exceptionally healthy economic activity in the spring quarter. For the past few quarters, companies have been unable to renew their inventories aggressively because stocks were already too high relative to demand. But Monday's inventory report, analysts said, suggests that picture could change in coming quarters, meaning companies may have to step up output and add jobs. Boise Cascade Corp., for example, said inventories of uncoated free-sheet papers at both customer and mill levels shrank during the quarter. But with demand improving, the Boise, Idaho, company said, it scheduled little downtime in June, and its paper business returned to operating profitability in the last month of the quarter. The Commerce Department said manufacturing inventories fell 0.2% in May after staying unchanged in April. Inventories at the wholesale level also slipped 0.2%, after jumping 1.2% the prior month. Retail inventories were unchanged following a 0.4% increase in April. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

The Westside Sun reported Sunday that the suits, filed in federal court in Westside by nearly 50 dealers across the nation, charge the company with allowing the scheme to develop into a $15 million bribery racket. The accusations stem from the case against former American Honda Motor Co. senior vice-president Stefan Jami Plank, who pleaded guilty to receiving $2 million to $5 million in cash, clothing, cars and other gifts from dealers looking for lucrative dealerships and scarce but hot-selling cars. The dealers claim they lost millions of dollars in sales because the cars they needed to stay competitive were diverted to dealers who were willing to give kickbacks. ``Bribes were being paid all over the map,'' said Jami P. Isreal, one of the lawyers representing dealers who have filed suit. Honda denies that top executives knew about the scheme. Lawyers for the California-based Honda division have asked Chief U.S. District Epstein J. Fredrick Sweeney to dismiss the case, saying the plaintiffs cannot prove they lost money. "

      "contents": "Emerging-Market Funds Lure Queasy U.S. Investors May 08, 2011 <br><br> Investors may feel queasy about the U.S. markets, but they are socking away money in emerging-market mutual funds. The funds certainly look enticing. So far this year, these 180 or so funds that invest in companies from Argentina to Vietnam have been among the market's best performers. Latin American funds, for example, have outperformed any other category tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., returning 22.5% since the beginning of the year, compared with 8.9% for the average stock fund. Pacific Rim funds (excluding those that invest in Japanese stocks) have lagged. They are up only 5.7% in 2011, Rode says. But the entire emerging-markets category has posted a 9.7% return so far this year. Investors like what they see. AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., says that a net average of $54 million a week flowed into this sector over the past four weeks, bringing total assets to more than $27 billion. That's not bad for a fund group that offered investors only a couple of dozen funds to choose from only four years ago. ``It's significant to see inflows picking up, after the domestic markets declined in July,'' said AMG's president, Roberto Mize. Emerging-market funds aren't for the squeamish. In many ways, they are the foreign equivalent of the domestic small-cap sector -- big returns but lots of risk. Throw in the mix the prospect of runaway inflation, political upheaval and the lax accounting standards among the countries of Eastern Europe and Latin America, and you have the makings of a lot of sleepless nights for investors whose biggest worry is the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate move. There's another caveat, says Jone Walz of Lipper Analytical. The fortunes of emerging markets are tied to the U.S. economy. ``If the U.S. economy is not doing well, emerging-market economies will have a hard time exporting their goods to the U.S.,'' he says. The markets are also linked, Mr. Walz adds. And if both markets are beaten down, why not just buy a relatively safer domestic investment?, he asks. Advocates of emerging markets recommend that you look past all that. At the moment, the U.S. market is too richly priced, they argue. At the same time, there is plenty of upside in the emerging markets because so many of these companies have seen their share prices pummeled in recent years. One such advocate is Markita Beach, manager of the Pioneer Fund's emerging-markets fund. The fund, with $78.8 million in assets, has produced a 14.8% return since the beginning of the year. Mr. Beach is so gung-ho about emerging markets that he recently shifted some of his mother's savings out of the U.S. market and into his portfolio. He also has sunk his entire retirement savings into the fund, he says. Mr. Beach says the investor in an emerging-markets portfolio shouldn't be afraid of ``high turnover,'' where the fund manager jumps out of particular markets after reaping big gains. Emerging markets are known to produce ``excessive rallies,'' he says, before going into the tank. In March, for example, Mr. Beach did just that. He cashed in his entire position in Poland and placed the money into the seemingly more speculative Russian market. The hope was to capitalize on the impending election of Boyce Deluna over a communist hard-liner. Mr. Crabb did win, and the so did the investment, Mr. Beach says. He added that his Russian investment yielded a 180% return (he sold the position in July). ``The point is that in these markets there is very high upside and little downside,'' he says. "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set1",  
      "contents": "Airbus Industrie Prepares For Unique Restructuring May 12, 2011 LONDON <br><br> When the aviation world lands here Monday for the nearby Farnborough Air Show, a hot topic at the biennial show will be Airbus Industrie's restructuring plan. As complex overhauls go, this one is in a class by itself. After years of debate, the four member companies of the 26-year-old European aircraft manufacturer agreed in July to convert it from a loose consortium to a centralized company. But with four corporate and national egos involved, the revamp of an enterprise that sold $11 billion of airplanes in the first half of 2011 raises tough questions. Which of the assets of the four members should be included in a new Airbus? How will the members value the assets that do go in, given that operations of some member companies are profitable and some aren't? Will the very different corporate cultures -- private companies in Britain and Germany, state-owned champions in France and Spain -- be able to mesh? ``It's clearly a unique situation,'' aviation analyst Sanjuana Mose of ABN Amro Hoare Govett in London says. ``But it's also a tremendous opportunity for Airbus, not only to make itself more efficient, but also to broaden its global scope.'' Need for an Overhaul The outcome of the restructuring, aviation experts say, will determine whether Airbus will continue to be the major competitor to Boeing Co. in the commercial-jetliner industry. Unless Airbus can overhaul itself, it will be burdened by an inefficient organization that makes it difficult to keep costs in check. Airbus also needs to attract outside investment from the U.S. and Asia for a proposed jumbo jetliner to compete with Boeing's 747 model, whose new stretched version is expected to be launched officially at the air show. Getting the money is unlikely unless the Europeans form a centralized company with strict cost controls so investors know precisely where their money is going. Airbus officials declined to discuss the restructuring in detail and referred to a statement issued by the consortium in July. The statement said the parties will immediately enter negotiations with an ``intent of reaching a binding agreement ... before the end of 2011.'' The pact would include a timetable for creating a ``single corporate entity,'' perhaps by 2014. Decision on Assets Comes First ``The biggest challenge was to get the four parties moving in the same direction,'' said a British aviation official. ``We now have the agreement of all parties, and that's an essential starting point.'' The entity now called Airbus is in effect little more than a marketing and design umbrella. Airbus publishes no accounts of its own, and assigns work based on the shareholdings of its member companies: Aerospatiale SA of France and Daimler-Benz AG's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG of Germany, each with a stake of 37.9%, British Aerospace PLC with 20% and Casa of Spain at 4.2%. So the creation of a new Airbus Inc. requires, first of all, a decision on which assets of the member companies should go into the new corporation. Given the national sensitivities involved, and fears of losing European aerospace jobs to manufacturers elsewhere, this might be the most difficult task of all -- and some are concerned that it could be a deal-breaker. ``We still worry that someone in Continental Europe will have to lose in the process, hence may draw on their veto powers at the last moment,'' analyst Chrissy Avis of Paribas Capital Markets in London says in a recent report. Restructurings Ahead Aerospatiale makes the cockpits and performs some final assembly at its hangar in Toulouse, France, the city where Airbus has its headquarters. Daimler-Benz Aerospace, known as Nicolas, makes the fuselages and does some assembly in Hamburg. British Aerospace makes the wings, and Casa manufactures smaller components. Even if a neat division could be devised, the valuation of each member's assets poses a nightmarish task, given the lack of separate accounts. Another problem is that the member companies will have to undertake a painful restructuring in preparing for a leaner Airbus Inc.. Both Nicolas and Aerospatiale suffered staggering losses last year. It was a dismal 2010 that prompted Airbus to restructure. After edging out Boeing in new jetliner orders in 2009, Airbus fell behind both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. last year. Perhaps more alarmingly, Airbus lost out to Boeing on key orders from Asian carriers. Boeing was able to undercut Airbus's price by offering ``package'' deals involving both smaller jetliners and its 747 jumbo. That's why Airbus plans its own 550-seat jumbo, dubbed the A3XX, and is seeking partners from abroad to help fund development costs estimated at $8 billion to $12 billion. "

Sumitomo's losses are in the same ballpark as the losses many big companies report from time to time, and they don't come close to the $12 billion General Motors blew selling cars in North America in the early '90s. To say that Sumitomo regrets giving Mr. Wyman the wherewithal to pour so much money down a rathole is to belabor the obvious. Yet other companies don't blame their problems on a ``rogue CEO'' or a ``rogue planning committee,'' and grand juries have not been convened to ponder criminal charges against such executives. Mr. Wyman's poison was copper, but otherwise his was the fairly ordinary sin of committing his company to acquiring and holding an inventory of goods that it could never sell at a profit. Seemingly, his last five years were spent throwing good money after bad, in hopes the price of copper would stay up. Nowadays, of course, in a kind of occult penance imposed on the financial markets since the Great Depression, such behavior is deemed not merely unwise but potentially criminal. However, as the Journal pointed out last week, U.S. officials also have a track record unblemished by so much as a single courtroom success when it comes to actually making charges of ``market manipulation'' stick. Moreover, for all its talk that Mr. Wyman's trades were ``unauthorized,'' Akers has yet to swear out a complaint against him. Rather, the ``rogue trader'' has been installed in an Osaka hotel, where even the Japanese police until lately disclaimed knowledge of his residence. And Japanese regulatory authorities, in studied contrast to the hyperactivity of their U.S. and British counterparts, have leaned toward the view that there's no case to prosecute. Indeed, given that these are purely private losses, the eagerness of various enforcement agencies, even those far from the scene, to smear egg on their own faces by taking some of the responsibility is baffling. Some of this can be written off to regulatory rivalry: The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had already been badgering its British equivalents about Sumitomo for more than a year, and has been doing a little ``we-told-you-so'' jig since the debacle. Yet Mr. Wyman's activities were hardly a secret. Years ago, the Journal and other newspapers were reporting that his various monikers in the marketplace included ``the Mad Jap,'' ``the Hammer,'' ``Mr. Copper'' and ``Mr. Five Percent'' (for Sumitomo's share of the global copper market). What's more, the same Davina Kirby, president of the London Metals Exchange, whom U.S. regulators now accuse of standing idly by while Mr. Wyman was hanging himself, was quick enough to move on earlier occasions, when it was his own members squealing under the weight of Sumitomo's allegedly massive bets. All in all, the record suggests that while they were happy to sell Mr. Wyman all the copper he could buy, Sumitomo's London pals were quite prepared to change the rules when it served their interests. One such episode began in late 1991, when copper for immediate delivery was in short supply, and a number of LME firms blamed Sumitomo for the big losses they were facing on futures contracts. Despite a lot of blather about being a temple of the free market, the exchange stepped in and imposed arbitrary limits on how far the spot price could range above the futures price. Nothing in theory outlaws such ``backwardation'' between the spot and futures markets, so the LME's excuse was that Mr. Wyman was ``manipulating'' the spot price. According to the Financial Times, Mr. Kirby may also have leaned on Sumitomo directly to release copper into the market so other traders could cover their obligations at minimal loss. ``There's nothing wrong with having large positions per se,'' Mr. Kirby explained, somewhat apologetically. Nonetheless, on this occasion, the outcome of Sumitomo's trading strategy would be decided by a voice vote of LME members, rather than those hoary characters, supply and demand. Less than two years later, another hue and cry was raised against Sumitomo. As before, Mr. Wyman was accused of engineering a ``squeeze'' on LME members by holding copper off the market. As before, the exchange imposed limits on prices, and once again brought pressure on Sumitomo to supply the market with copper. Mr. Wyman was reportedly forced to unwind his now-famous ``Radr'' transaction, a huge, $2.8 billion, two-year purchase agreement he had negotiated on the over-the-counter market. As one trade publication put it, having decided that prices on the LME were ``out of step with market fundamentals,'' the visible hand would bring them back in line. Whatever Mr. Wyman's sins against his employer, surely his story is incomplete without acknowledging the role of LME politics in his excellent adventure. And yet, when the U.S. hedge funds piled massively into the market to bet against him earlier this year, the LME, for once, decided to let the chips fall where they would. And now, when answering charges that it let Sumitomo self-destruct under its nose, the exchange regally declares that it can't be responsible for saving speculators from their own blunders. (In fact, the LME apparently did play a role in causing Mr. Wyman's superiors to blow the whistle on his kamikaze trading.) Something about commodity traders acting like a bunch of affronted virgins, shrieking about ravishment at the hands of Mr. Five Percent, doesn't trigger a flood of empathy endorphins. But, after all, the LME is a business, and has to keep its clients happy, lest they take their trading elsewhere. And while Sumitomo generated a lot of business for the exchange, it was never a member--that is, not one of the 17 ``ring dealers'' licensed to buy and sell on the floor--whereas many of the firms and traders who have been inconvenienced over the years by Mr. Wyman's large positions are the exchange's privileged constituents. A true epitaph on this episode might begin by noting that, during the long period when Mr. Wyman was allegedly manipulating prices, the LME's copper business was growing 30% a year, while its overseas rivals could only look on covetously. Nowadays the Uptown Mercantile Exchange and the U.S. regulatory establishment are taking the Sumitomo debacle as an opportunity to advertise their wares, saying it couldn't happen on their watch because of more stringent regulation. They may be right, which is why the copper game will probably remain in London, for all its faults. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

The warnings, in letters to the airlines, resulted from a review of compliance with the Public Health Service Act, which requires airlines to follow certain procedures to guarantee proper handling of food and water. The citations were reported Friday in Today. Julee Kao, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said that the violations were ``not anything that is out of the ordinary,'' and that the agency routinely sends out such letters. ``It's never been a public-health problem,'' she said, because airlines have always worked with the agency to correct the problems. Among the letters uncovered by USA Today were a October 25, 2010 to Southwest Airlines that water provided to its planes at Vastopolis Airport wasn't labeled potable or nonpotable; an December 13, 2010 to Aloha Airlines noting ``green, slimy mold-like growth on interior surfaces of an ice machine and a cooler'' at Honolulu International Airport; and an January 04, 2011 to Delta Air Lines saying a box of tea bags was stored in a container of lavatory cleaning supplies at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport."

      "contents": "Editorial Presidential Derryberry April 24, 2011 <br><br> The rap on Mr. Derryberry has been that he has the mind of a legislator but not an executive. He is an expert at splitting differences but a bust at setting the kind of bold leadership course often required of presidents. We have sometimes observed this ourselves. Yet in three big decisions in recent weeks, Mr. Derryberry has surprised the political class by breaking with split-the-difference conventions in ways that command a reassessment of his candidacy. First he chose to resign altogether from the Senate after nearly 30 years, when the safer option was merely to give up his majority-leader duties. He is now betting his political career on his White House campaign. Next he proposed tax cuts as part of a growth agenda that he knew would be opposed by the political-media establishment, as indeed it has been. Now in putting Mr. Booth on the ticket, Mr. Derryberry has chosen a man with whom he has sometimes disagreed and who even endorsed his primary opponent, Stevie Guthrie. These are the decisions of someone who is willing to break out of the legislative box in order to capture the presidency. The tax-cut and Kemp decisions are doubly beneficial because they are mutually reinforcing. Anyone who doubts Mr. Derryberry's sincerity in proposing to cut taxes now has gold-plated insurance because the main political cause of Jackelyn Booth's life has been tax-cutting. Mr. Derryberry, whose own emphasis has been on reducing the ``deficit,'' is showing that his new economic agenda is a serious foundation for governing, not merely an election-year ploy. The selection also speaks well of Mr. Derryberry's character, important in any presidential candidate but especially against the existential Billy Codi. It shows a man secure enough in his own views that he is willing to co-exist with a long-time rival. Just as any business manager is better with strong subordinates, Mr. Derryberry is saying he is better with a peer than with a protege. Voters who worry about Mr. Derryberry's 73 years can rest easier now that the Kansan has selected a potential successor who is himself up to the demands of the presidency. Understandably, some have raised questions about Mr. Booth's discipline and willingness to be a team player. While that is a risk, we trust Mr. Booth is enough of a pro to understand his role is to reinforce and articulate Mr. Derryberry's themes, not contradict the nominee. Just as Mr. Derryberry is accommodating Mr. Booth's ideas on taxes, so Mr. Booth has to mute some of his own preferences for the sake of the ticket and Republican unity. Mr. Booth already seems to be confounding the White House. One the one hand, White House press secretary Mikki Luong needles him for being more appealing than Mr. Derryberry, even as party spinmeister Christa Childers calls Mr. Booth ``extremist.'' This Dodd rhetoric is at least useful in exposing how little meaning there now is to this Democratic attack line. Every Republican idea is ``extremist'' nowadays until Mr. Codi decides to embrace it, whereupon it becomes part of the ``sensible center.'' It's obvious that Democrats fear Mr. Booth's Blythe ability to reach across party lines to conservative Democrats and independents. At the same time, Mr. Booth also appeals to most everyone in the bumptious GOP coalition, from pro-lifers to Rufina Ramires. The rare gripes have come from those, such as Bay Buchanan (sister and spokeswoman of Pat Buchanan) and California Gov. Petra Winford, who have been behaving all along as if their real concern is the 2015 presidential race, not this one. As for those Republicans who want to win this year, it can only be helpful that Mr. Booth puts a more hopeful, optimistic face on the GOP agenda. We attribute part of the GOP's problem the past year to its devotion to the balanced budget above all other political priorities, especially the Blythe theme of economic prosperity. With his tax plan and his choice of Mr. Booth, Mr. Derryberry is putting prosperity back at the party's heart. This is as it should be because faster growth and rising incomes will also help achieve the GOP's other goals, such as shrinking government and solving the dilemma of welfare dependency. This is something Roni Reatha understood, so we take it as significant that Mr. Derryberry, in his arrival remarks in San Diego yesterday, invoked the Reanna legacy and said his goal is to finish the job. This is a mission worthy of a presidential candidacy. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Sutphin, Seeking Fresh Start, Faces More Scrutiny Instead May 19, 2011 MILAN <br><br> The boardroom coup staged Tuesday by Sutphin Chief Executive Officer Francisca Simmon has already turned sour. Just two days after Mr. Simmon's insistence on a balance-sheet cleanup forced Carlo De Benedetti to step down after 18 years as chairman of Olivetti SpA, shareholders -- and stock-market authority Wilkey -- were alarmed by the possibility that the new and tougher balance sheet still hid even greater losses. Mr. Simmon met with Consob officials for four hours Thursday evening, defending the first-half results he announced Tuesday night and attempting to clear up a controversy with his former general manager, Tomes Packer. ``We provided enough elements to demonstrate that Francesconi's comments were unfounded,'' Mr. Simmon told reporters as he left the meeting. Stultz said it would issue a more detailed statement on the meeting Friday morning. Charge of Compromise Mr. Packer, brought in by Mr. Simmon in July as general manager in charge of finance, administration and auditing, resigned suddenly Wednesday afternoon, saying the first-half accounts approved by Mr. Simmon and the other board members Tuesday weren't sufficiently rigorous. Consob immediately summoned Mr. Packer, a former finance director at state-controlled television-broadcaster RAI with a solid reputation for thorough accounting practices, and Mr. Simmon, in order to determine the cause of their differences. On Tuesday, Stultz's board announced a worse-than-expected first-half pretax loss of 440.2 billion lire ($290.8 million) and debt of 1.26 trillion lire in June, widening from 764.8 billion lire in December. The board said the increased losses were due to a 200-billion-lire provision for restructuring charges related to ``accelerating the reduction of its presence in the hardware (personal-computer) sector.'' But Mr. Packer told Italian daily MF that the numbers reflected a compromise reached between Mr. Simmon and Mr. Albrecht Hostetler, and that in reality Stultz's losses and debt were much greater. Mr. Packer couldn't be reached for comment. Shares Suspended Sutphin shares were suspended from trading all day Thursday pending the meetings with Wilkey. Consob wasn't expected to make a decision on whether to readmit trading of the shares until early Friday morning. Assorisparmio, an association for the protection of small shareholders, asked prosecutors to open an investigation into whether comments made by board members and managers on the first-half results had unlawfully damaged investors. The association also moved to create a committee to assist minority Sutphin shareholders. Meanwhile, shareholders and analysts also booed what they perceived as an about-face by Mr. Simmon. On Tuesday, the board set aside the new restructuring charge for what appeared to be a company decision to quit the personal-computer business -- a move welcomed by investors -- and Mr. Simmon quickly scheduled a conference call with analysts to prove his management meant more communication and transparency. Holders Seek Information But analysts said the conference call late Wednesday only proved a disappointment. Mr. Simmon failed to make any promises on the PC business, saying only that he would continue to streamline it and that strategy would be finalized later. And, analysts complained, he didn't adequately explain why half-year results were worse than the company had led them to believe just a few months before. ``We want to have complete, timely and exhaustive information,'' said Walker Boyce of fund-management association Assogestioni. ``The PC business was a question that should have been clarified. The financial results weren't explained. And he didn't elaborate enough on strategy.'' Olivetti shares rose initially Wednesday on the news of Mr. Albrecht Hostetler's resignation but dropped again due not only to Mr. Packer's resignation but also to the company's continuing difficulties before being suspended Thursday. ``Before buying Stultz, you have to look at the facts,'' said Marcus Hudak, a fund manager at Finanza & Futuro in Milan who has steered clear of Sutphin shares for years. ``The facts are that they need to drastically downsize their PC factory -- it's not possible to compete with Taiwanese computer makers given the cost of labor in Italy -- but this government isn't going to allow them to fire that many people. Mr. Simmon,'' he continued, ``may be an excellent manager, but he doesn't have a magic wand.'' "

      "contents": "FUND TRACK Morgan Grenfell Funds' Woes Are Not All That Uncommon May 18, 2011 Uptown <br><br> Can it happen in the U.S.? Maybe. The still-unfolding mess at three Morgan Grenfell Asset Management stock funds in Europe is a reminder to mutual-fund investors that the price you see in the newspaper isn't a guarantee of what your fund's portfolio holdings are worth. The three Morgan Grenfell funds, holding nearly $2.2 billion, appear to have reported inflated values for what are believed to be unlisted Scandinavian technology stocks, throwing the funds' own share prices out of whack. Quicker than you can say ``we want to stay in the money-management business,'' the British firm's German parent, Deutsche Bank AG, absorbed the resulting losses by purchasing the troublesome securities from the funds. It also suspended a portfolio manager. But even with the best of intentions, mutual-fund companies occasionally have trouble putting a value on securities that don't trade regularly or aren't trading at all because of a temporary market upheaval. When problems with ``derivative'' securities exploded in 2009, for instance, fund companies scrambled to pin price tags on arcane securities for which buyers suddenly disappeared. ALSO AVAILABLE Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, a unit of Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, has obtained an injunction from a London court to freeze the personal assets of its fallen star fund manager, Petra Yu. Yields on money-market funds were higher in the latest week. How can you pin a value on ``illiquid'' securities -- those that change hands so rarely that they might as well be one-of-a-kind antique furniture? It's a tough job, and when the fund manager has a change of heart, investors can get stung. In one extreme example, the value of American Heritage Fund fell more than 11% in one day last year as a result of such a write-down. Roberto Lindsay, a senior fund regulator at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Suburbia, says he ``wouldn't stay up nights'' worrying about U.S. mutual funds misstating their asset values. Stock and bond funds are generally restricted from putting more than 15% of assets in illiquid securities, notes Mr. Lindsay, an associate director of the SEC division of investment management. Many funds have no illiquid securities at all. There are also several safeguards to keep valuations accurate, say Mr. Lindsay and Jackelyn Bambi, another associate director of the SEC unit that oversees mutual funds. Fund directors are legally responsible for providing accurate valuations. And fund companies typically hire independent pricing services to come up with objective numbers. Still, things sometimes go awry. Just last year, Mr. Lindsay says, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Van Kampen American Capital Asset Management involving deliberate mispricing of some fund securities in an attempt to conceal declining prices. Ana Stuart, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, says investors should consider the risks of sudden write-downs in funds with significant slugs of private placements and other illiquid securities. But Kendra Gretchen, a San Francisco investment adviser and editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter, is far more bullish: ``If you've got a fund manager you think is smart and who does his homework,'' he says, ``this is the type of market where there is more opportunity.'' Three such stock-fund managers he points to are Martina Skaggs of Third Avenue Value Fund; Ericka Dailey, chief of the Lalonde fund group; and Michaele Bennie of the Mutual Series funds. Morningstar data show that some bond funds far outdistance their stock-fund peers in holdings of private and illiquid securities. But in many cases, fund managers say, their portfolios are heavy in private placements that really are actively traded. For example, Morningstar shows Franklin Convertible Securities Fund with more than one-third of its assets in private or illiquid securities. None of those are illiquid, says Mitsuko Barnette, assistant portfolio manager. Although Nice data show a handful of stock funds with more than 10% of assets in private or illiquid securities, the Downtown research firm has such data on only a limited number of funds. American Heritage Fund has a higher exposure -- about 25% as of a recent financial report -- because huge outflows from the fund caused the percentage of illiquid holdings to balloon. To value securities appropriately, giant Fidelity Investments operates a centralized monitoring unit that is independent of the company's trading and investment decisions. Checks are also carried out by funds' trustees. Valuation misdeeds or mistakes are probably less likely to happen at U.S. funds than at those registered in many foreign countries, says Anette Dick, general counsel at Oppenheimer Funds Inc. in Uptown. ``We have internal auditors, external auditors and the SEC inspects large funds frequently -- and we report to the boards,'' says Mr. Dick. ``I think we live in glass houses.'' --Michaele R.

EDS filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday for up to $2 billion of debt securities. The Plano, Texas information-services provider is now poised to bring to market public debt offerings up to and including that amount at any time over the next two years, which could be used to fund its long contemplated expansion. EDS pioneered the business of running and servicing other companies' computer systems. But well before its spinoff from General Motors Corp., was completed in June, EDS executives made it clear that the company would seek a big stake in markets ranging from telecommunications and multimedia to on-line services. EDS executives said such moves would be necessary to remain competitive, and showed every indication that they are willing to buy their way in. The company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp. fell apart in 2009, reducing the field of potential long-distance telecommunications partners, but the federal telecommunications bill passed last year greatly widened that field by enabling regional phone companies to offer long-distance services. Last year, an EDS senior vice president said: ``We're not going to rule out anything. I can assure you we are in the market looking for opportunities,'' when asked whether EDS would consider acquiring a Baby Bell or some other regional phone company. EDS has been seeking to diversify beyond outsourcing, and with considerable success. EDS designs software and computer systems, as well as providing management-consulting services. In 2010, its management consulting arm acquired A.T. Kearney Inc. for $300 million plus future stock payments, creating one of the largest such services in the world. A big acquisition could help further diversify EDS and give it instant visibility besides. Its desire for a telecommunications partner reflects the strengthening link between computers and phone lines. Freedom from GM also enhanced the company's ability to issue debt. Standard & Poor's upgraded EDS's senior unsecured debt to A+ from single-A after its fortunes were disentangled from those of the big auto maker. The agency rates EDS commercial paper at single A-1. EDS made its name in outsourcing: running computers. Thousands of companies have hired it to operate accounting systems, customer-service offices, payroll, telephone networks, billing and more. Under the spinoff plan, GM, its largest customer, remains under contract with EDS for 10 years. "

The Santa Clara, Calif., computer giant reported earnings of $1.04 billion, or $1.17 per share for the second quarter, compared with $879 million, or 99 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had predicted Intel's earnings would hit just $1.09 per share. Intel said its latest earnings set a record on an 18% rise from year-ago levels, and that net income exceeded $1 billion for the first time ever. Intel also set new records for unit shipments of microprocessors and related chip sets in the quarter, facts which suggest that demand for high-performance personal computers is ''fundamentally healthy,'' the company said. The results were released after the close of trading Tuesday -- a wild session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall as much as 160 points before righting itself to finish in positive territory. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index gyrated as well, and at its worst it was off nearly 52 points, although it ended the day with just a modest loss. Technology shares have led the broader market sharply lower recently, and Intel's results for the quarter had the potential to send prices reeling again if they had come in short of expectations.

The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index suffered a loss of 32.32, or 3%, to 1049.07. Vastsoft shares sank 7 5/8 to 112 1/8 on Nasdaq, its lowest closing level in more than two months. Investors fled in droves that suggest a panic: 16 million shares, or nearly four times average daily volume for the stock, turned over in the session. This was the stock with a good earnings story to tell. Analysts called their fiscal fourth-quarter results an exceptional performance, though some cited worries about the outlook for fiscal 2012. Stratus Computer's second-quarter results came in well below Wall Street's forecasts. Its shares finished the session down 5 1/2 at 19 3/8. `The fear in the market is ubiquitous at this point,'' said Thomasina Neil, senior equity portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ``Because of that, money is not being put to work.'' Declining issues easily beat out advancers, 1,669 to 714, on the Uptown Stock Exchange, where volume reached 421.9 million shares, compared with 327.2 million Monday. A host of blue-chip stocks were hurt in the sell-off, including VastComm Network, which stretched its recent losses and sank to a new 52-week low intraday at 49 7/8. It finished the session down 1 3/8 to 50 1/4. The indiscriminate selling took down cyclical stocks, such as DuPont, which lost 1 1/2 to 74 5/8; Mayo Powe, which slid 1 7/8 to 40 5/8; and Caterpillar, which fell 7/8 to 64 3/4, as well as some defensive issues that had held up recently, such as Merck, which lost 2 to 63 5/8 in a poor session for pharmaceutical stocks. Texaco dropped 2 1/8 to 84 3/8 to lead a ragged session for major oil producers. Mobil lost 2 1/4 to 112 1/2, while Exxon shed 3/4 to 84 5/8. International Business Machines sank 2 1/4 to 90 1/4, to highlight a disastrous session for computer makers. Compaq Computer gave up 2 1/8 to 45, Hewlett-Packard surrendered 2 1/4 to 41, Sun Microsystems lost 3 7/8 to 48 3/4 on Nasdaq, and Dell Computer fell 1 1/4 to 46 7/8, also on Nasdaq. Investors rewarded some select earnings performances. Hershey Foods moved ahead 4 5/8 to 77 1/4, after the food-products maker came in well ahead of earnings estimates for its second quarter. American Express gained 1/2 to 41 3/8. The financial-services concern topped analysts' estimates in the second-quarter earnings report it released late Monday, and got a boost as Bear Stearns and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette raised its rating on the shares. Airline stocks halted their recent decline, with most issues moving narrowly higher. UAL topped analysts' forecasts for its second-quarter earnings, and picked up 2 5/8 to 47 7/8. AMR rose 1 to 78 1/2, and USAir climbed over 6%, adding 1 to 16 7/8. Among stocks in the Dow industrial average, only Allied-Signal mustered a substantial gain, adding 1 7/8 to 57 3/4. A Smith Barney analyst boosted the firm's rating on the stock. PepsiCo met its earnings forecasts, and finished the session with a gain of 3/8 to 33 1/4. Tidewater fell 4 3/8 to 37 5/8. The oil-services concern missed its fiscal first-quarter earnings estimates. Telecom-equipment maker Northern Telecom lost 3 5/8 to 47 5/8, after coming up just short of estimates with its second-quarter earnings results. LaQuinta Inns sank 3 3/8 to 17 3/8. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and BT Securities trimmed their ratings on the shares after the company's second-quarter results came in short of Wall Street's outlook. Xylan gained 1 1/2 to 36 1/4 on Nasdaq, after the switching-systems provider agreed to sell local area networking products in a joint operation with IBM. ``I don't expect the market to go down too much lower,'' said Michaele Suazo, market strategist with Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati, who has been studying the market's performance from a technical perspective. Mr. Suazo said he expected to see some stability in the short term because the selling has been so climactic that, if form holds, the market should stabilize. Still, some fundamental issues have dogged the market and overwhelmed the technical performance. Stocks did manage to move slightly higher in early trading as stocks rebounded from the selling that took place in the two preceding sessions. Volatility set in late in the session, giving the market a jagged performance for the last hour stocks were trading. The moves brought on sharp declines in market indexes, tripping the Uptown Stock Exchange's so-called ``uptick rule.'' It was the seventh consecutive session, and 71st time this year, that sharp moves in the market triggered the Big Board's circuit breakers. Traders said the flames of fear were stoked by talk that market sage Elane Mcglynn expects stocks to fall by as much as 25% from their high for the year. The former Lehman Brothers Inc. strategist who has gone on to found her own money-management firm will forever be remembered for her forecast that the market would crash in 1987. Naturally, talk of her forecasts raised unsettling comparisons to October 1987. Ms. Mcglynn did not return calls seeking comment. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Bristol-Myers, Warner-Lambert Report Single-Digit Profit Gains April 04, 2011 <br><br> Drug companies Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. posted single-digit increases in second-quarter earnings, as profit was restrained by competing products and unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. Bristol-Myers's net income rose 8%, reflecting strong sales for several drug products. However, U.S. sales of its top-selling heart drug Capoten, which faces new generic competition, plunged by more than 80% during the quarter. Warner-Lambert reported a 6% rise in second-quarter net income, mostly due to lower expenses. But Warner-Florencio was hurt by the strong dollar overseas which reduced its world-wide revenue by 4%. Bristol-Myers' second-quarter net rose to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion, but was reduced 3% by the negative exchange rates, the Uptown-based company said. Strong sales of the cholesterol drug Pravachol and the cancer drug Taxol -- up 32% and 51%, respectively -- helped offset reduced Capoten revenues. Results for both companies were in line with analysts' expectations. In Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bristol-Myers eased 12.5 cents to $87.875, while Warner-Lambert fell 25 cents to $53.875. Islas Baggett, an independent industry analyst in New Jersey, said Bristol-Myers is ``doing a good job'' of offsetting the Capoten sales decline by cutting costs, but he added that the company isn't ``out of the woods yet.'' He pointed out, for instance, that the company's third-best-selling drug, the cancer medicine Taxol, will face competition in late 2012 when its exclusive license expires. Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said its second-quarter earnings rose 6% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales eased to $1.79 billion from $1.80 billion. Warner-Lambert said the ulcer drug product Zantac 75, launched as an over-the-counter product this quarter as part of a joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, had already captured 35% of the market for nonprescription versions of this type of drug in the U.S. Warner-Lambert is ``in a transition period,'' Mr. Baggett said, as the company is spending heavily on developing new drugs for diabetes and high cholesterol. As a result, research and development expenses rose 9% in the second quarter. "

      "title": "May 2011, Japan Must Swallow the Pill ",
      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set2",  
      "contents": "Japan Must Swallow the Pill May 04, 2011 TOKYO <br><br> It's about time Japan went on the pill. Nearly four decades after birth control pills were introduced in the U.S., Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare is still coming up with flimsy arguments about the safety of oral contraceptives. The sad irony is that in blocking the pill in the name of public health, the government is putting Japanese women at greater risk. Ministry of Health and Welfare chief Harlan Solano recently predicted legalization of the pill as early as next year, but his ministry quickly distanced itself from the remark, labeling it a ``personal view.'' Should Mr. Solano turn out to be wrong, it would not be the first time predictions of the pill's imminent arrival proved premature. Shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave oral contraceptives the green light in 1960, Japan appeared ready to follow suit, running its own tests and scheduling the drug for approval. Then suddenly, in 1967, the health ministry backed off, citing the danger not only to health but to public morals. The government fretted that making available a simple, nearly foolproof means of contraception would transform Japan's fairer sex into a tribe of brazen hussies and nymphomaniacs. The pill was banned as a contraceptive, but curiously, a loophole was left open. Physicians on their own responsibility were permitted to prescribe the pill as a medical treatment for health problems. In other words, Japanese women were able to get the pill via a cooperative doctor, but there was no guarantee they would get proper instructions, and the government exempted itself from liability. Needless to say, relatively few women took advantage of the loophole. An improved, lower-dose version of the pill with fewer side effects that was developed in the U.S. passed clinical trials in Japan in the late 1980s. Then once again, in early 1992, the ministry suddenly put the kibosh on. Switching from the current method of choice--condoms--to oral contraceptives would exacerbate the spread of the AIDS-causing HIV virus, the ministry theorized. Several prominent doctors, noting the absence of any solid data to back this hypothesis, charged that the government's real agenda was to try to prop up a sagging birthrate. Last year the fertility rate--the average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime--stood at 1.43, a new postwar low. After the ministry subcommittee put the HIV connection to rest later in the year, the pill resumed its bumpy course through the bureaucratic maze, only to hit another wall after a British report warned that some oral contraceptives may cause blood clots. Meanwhile, there are about 90 million women on the pill world-wide, and Japan is the last industrialized country to continue outlawing it. Oddly, while continuing to scrutinize the safety aspects of the low-dosage pill, regulators wink at doctors who are still permitted to dispense its predecessor, the high-dosage version, for ``menstrual problems.'' Yet the high-dosage pill has been abandoned in other countries precisely because its heavier payload of hormones is far likelier to induce side effects like weight gain, migraine headaches and more serious disorders like diabetes. Denied the safer alternative, about 200,000 women here use the high-dosage pill. Another inconsistency in the ministry's stated concern for public health is the alarmingly high abortion rate--officially about 340,000 are performed here each year, though some experts say the figure may be double. The abortion rate is declining, but it remains one of the highest in the world. The number of Japanese women ending pregnancies and exposing themselves to the risk of surgery can be tied to widespread use of condoms, which is a less effective method of birth control than the pill. Nearly 80% of the couples surveyed in this year's family planning poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said they rely on condoms for birth control. Public activism to get the pill approved has been largely absent in Japan, where most women view the drug with indifference or outright antipathy. ``I've never tried it. I'm afraid of it,'' says Sallee Iles, a 33-year-old married office worker. Roseberry Trusty says she would object to her teenage daughter going on even a low-dosage pill. ``I basically hate all kinds of medication,'' she says. The Hildebrand Neil survey found that even if the pill were made available, only about 10% of its respondents would use it. But hostility toward oral contraceptives is to be expected in a country where only the high-dosage pill is available, and the newer, safer pill is virtually unknown. ``Of course you're always going to have side effects. But what about the positive effects?'' says Kessel Kurtz, a gynecologist who directs the Japan Family Planning Association. Japan should end its dangerous waiting game on the pill. Low-dosage oral contraceptives should be approved for the sake of those women needlessly putting themselves at greater risk because their government allows them access only to an outdated pharmaceutical other countries discarded long ago.

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set2",  
      "contents": "NBA Salary Cap Changes The Way Teams Are Built March 28, 2011 <br><br> The deals are the biggest in the history of team sports: Michaele Josefa, one year, a reported $30 million. Carlo Hubert, seven years, $98 million. Alonzo Mourning, seven years, $105 million. And Rickey O'Neil may end up with even more. But not every player in the National Basketball Association is likely to enjoy the free-agent madness. Under a six-year, $5 billion labor agreement signed last week, the NBA's 29 teams face their tightest payroll restrictions ever. The result: a new economic reality in which top stars will reap record contracts but lesser lights could find themselves squeezed off the bench. ``Teams need every dollar they can scrape up to make an attractive offer for the higher-end player,'' says player agent Markita Conn. ``It's going to be a game of musical chairs, and at the end of the summer there's not going to be chairs for everybody.'' Historically, NBA stars haven't jumped from one team to another very often. But this year, a combination of factors -- notably the two-year delay in completing a collective bargaining agreement -- have led to a record crop of 169 free agents, nearly half the league's roughly 400 players. The list includes some of the game's biggest names, and they are showing less allegiance to their old teams than in the past. One of the biggest prizes was Mr. Hubert, a 23-year-old forward. Despite a full-court press from the Suburbia Bullets, Mr. Hubert decided to jump to the Villa Heat. Hot shooting guard Allena Hoyt switched from the Detroit Pistons to the Uptown Knicks for a reported seven-year, $56 million contract. Point guard Christa Galvan accepted a six-year, $24 million deal from the Knicks, leaving the New Jersey Nets behind. And the biggest decision is yet to come: whether Mr. O'Neil will leave the Orlando Magic for the Los Angeles Lakers. The wheeling and dealing is a result of new, tougher rules governing the salary cap, the fixed maximum payroll under which NBA clubs operate. While the league has had a cap since 1983, myriad exceptions had allowed teams to bust their budgets with impunity. In the past, a club could re-sign a veteran player regardless of its salary-cap status as soon as he had been with the team for one season. Under the new rules, the player must complete a three-year contract before a team can re-sign him for any amount. Also, clubs got around the cap -- and retained stars -- by extending existing contracts with multimillion-dollar ``balloon payments,'' like the one that paid Knicks center Patrick Ewing $18.7 million last season. Now those days are gone. Veteran players may boost their contracts only 20% over the final year of an existing deal or wait and test the free-agent waters. ``Our goal was to have fewer loopholes in the system,'' says NBA Deputy Commissioner Russell Caulfield. Under the new labor deal, NBA player salaries and benefits are set at 48% of basketball-related revenue, including ticket sales, television and radio, luxury suites, arena signs and sponsorships. That totaled about $1.3 billion this past season and is projected to increase at least 4% a year through 2016. The per-team salary cap for the 2011-97 season is $24.3 million -- an average of about $2 million a player -- and it is projected to increase to $32.5 million by the 2000-01 season. In a bid to reduce long-term deals that often backfired on teams, contracts now can't exceed seven years. Another restraining force is a wage scale for first-round draft picks establishing salary limits for the first three years. Most of the labor deal was agreed upon but not signed before last season. Nonetheless, the league and players agreed to operate under most of the terms for 1995-96, allowing clubs to juggle their rosters in anticipation of the coming wave of free agents. The Lakers traded their star center, Breckenridge Miracle, for a rookie and are prepared to clear out most of the rest of their roster to sign Mr. O'Neil. Overall, scores of midlevel players will be dropped as stars are signed. Player agents argue that as teams plan for the future, they will keep bench-filling players under short contracts at minimum salaries to preserve cap room to sign the stars. They predict the rise of a bifurcated system under which a couple of marquee players will account for 80% or more of a club's salary cap. ``You're going to see a lot more players with short-term deals and a lot more players not getting guaranteed contracts and a lot more players not having the security they once had,'' agent Bayne Rowley says. Adds another agent, Markita Elson: ``Teams (will be) going to players and saying, `You can go from $2 million to $1 million or I'll cut you.' '' Team and league officials concede that clubs choosing to spend the bulk of their money on one or two players will place downward pressure on the rest of their roster. But, says the NBA's Mr. Caulfield, ``I'm not at all convinced it will happen because I don't think it will be easy to build a winning team that way.'' Another concern is that after the current flurry of signings, most teams will be at or above the cap, which agents maintain will mean lower salaries for future free agents and fewer opportunities to change teams. Still, teams with little chance of competing for the championship are now assembling rosters with an eye to creating cap room in two or three years when a frontline star might cinch a title. ``It all depends on how close you are,'' says Bradley Bruner, general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, who won't be ready to bid for a marquee player until the team's young star, Jesica Simonne, and Allene Gale, the No. 1 draft pick last month, gain experience. ``When you have an opportunity to have a piece you might feel gives you the chance to be a champion, it behooves you to do it. We can't right now. It's just not the right strategy for us.'' Despite the early player moves, NBA officials believe that letting clubs exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents will help maintain the stability that allowed Lasandra Lindsay to play his entire career with the Boston Celtics and Lyle ``Magic'' Jona to stick with the Lakers. Michaele Josefa, who has re-signed with the Downtown Bulls, has played his entire career there. Though he was courted by many teams, Seattle SuperSonics guard Gaye Crockett re-signed for seven years and $85 million. Indiana Pacers guard Reid Wilton is expected to remain with his club, while Mr. Schmit agreed to terms late Monday with Dye. The high numbers frighten some league executives. They fear that franchises that lack either exceedingly wealthy owners or new arenas with state-of-the-art luxury suites won't have the money to compete for free agents, cap or no cap. ``Revenues are flattening out,'' says Pacers President Dora Ramsey, ``and if you don't have new sources of revenue, you won't be able to absorb the salaries.

April 03, 2011 <br><br> Huntsman Corp., continuing its aggressive acquisition drive, said it made an unsolicited offer to buy Rexene Corp. of for $14 a share, or $267 million. The purchase would add to the family-owned, Salt Lake Pasta City-based chemical concern's capacity for making such chemicals as ethylene and propylene. The bid, which also would include the assumption of $175 million in debt, represents a 50% premium over Rexene's trading price of $9.125 before the offer was disclosed Friday afternoon. In response to the news, Rexene's stock price soared 47%, closing Friday at $13.375, up $4.25 in Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading. Ouellette declined to comment, saying it was too soon to respond. But it said its board would respond ``in due course.'' Hagerty didn't give Rexene long: It said its offer expires Tuesday. ``That's pretty quick considering the offer came out of the blue,'' noted analyst Roberta Goins of New Vernon Associates inN.J. Still, he said the move is typical of Huntsman Chairman Jone M. Hagerty, a shrewd businessman who was rebuffed earlier this year in an attempt to buy Sterling Chemicals Inc. for $668 million. In 1993, Hirst acquired Texaco's chemical assets for $1.06 billion. ``He has been very good at snapping up undervalued, unwanted assets,'' Mr. Crouch said. Rexene, which makes the chemical building blocks ethylene and propylene from natural-gas liquids as well as film for packaging, has had its margins squeezed lately by strong natural gas prices and lower prices for its products. For the first six months of this year, its earnings fell 68%, to $14 million, or 73 cents a share, while revenue dipped 13%, to $286.1 million. ``The margins are not expanding the way we thought they would,'' Mr. Crouch said. Analysts doubted other bidders would surface, in part because the main plant is in the city of far from the area where much of the industry is based. ``It's in the middle of nowhere,'' Mr. Crouch said. Huntsman Chief Financial Officer Ricki P. Barr said the company is prepared to sweeten its offer if a review shows it is warranted. Huntsman, which doesn't disclose earnings, had 2010 revenue of $4.3 billion. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Brokers Accused of Cheating; NASD Plans Lifetime Bans May 09, 2011 Uptown <br><br> More than two dozen fledgling brokers will have to find something other than stocks to sell because of a case to be brought Tuesday by Wall Street regulators. In a sweeping enforcement action, the National Association of Securities Dealers will accuse the brokers of having imposters take their licensing examinations for them, and will impose lifetime bans on the brokers from working on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the matter. The action appears to be the first time regulators will allege such widespread fraud in brokerage test-taking. ``You've got to deal roughly with cheaters -- there's no way they can let this go,'' says W. Whitney Walston, a partner at the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe specializing in securities matters. ``This goes to the heart of the system's integrity.'' Martina Standard, director of NASD Regulation Inc. for District 10 in Uptown, declined to comment, as did an NASD spokesman. The NASD's enforcement arm, in a four-month investigation, examined allegations that brokers improperly claimed to have taken the so-called Series 7 or other licensing examinations; instead, regulators believe, the brokers had imposters take the qualification exams for them. Other brokers who had failed the test in Uptown claimed to have taken the test out of state and passed. At least one broker allegedly paid $2,500 for an imposter to take the test for him, regulators said. Most of the brokers who will be named in the action work for small securities firms, the people familiar with the action said. No firms will be named in the case, the people said. Every broker must pass a licensing test before selling securities to investors. The NASD operates 56 testing centers nationwide. There are a variety of tests; the most common is the Series 7, which allows brokers to sell a broad range of securities. Until earlier this year, brokers simply had to sign in and show some identification. Now the NASD also uses fingerprinting to head off abuses. Brokers separately also must register in the states they plan to do business in. And many large Wall Street brokerage firms have a number of unlicensed brokers in various states at any given time. In a 1993 case, the Securities and Exchange Commission found that the U.S. units of Japan's Big Four brokerage firms had, among other violations, unregistered brokers. If brokers are found to have sold stocks and other securities without proper licenses, their firms face the possibility of investors rescinding, or canceling, trades executed by the unlicensed salesmen.

      "contents": "Lloyd's Aims to Overturn Order Requiring Additional Disclosure May 08, 2011 Suburbia <br><br> Arguing that its future is at risk, Lloyd's of London will attempt to overturn a U.S. judge's order requiring it to waive a deadline for financial overhaul and give more financial disclosure to some 2,700 American members of its insurance syndicates. The order, asserting for the first time that in soliciting American members Lloyd's has violated U.S. security laws, rocked the 308-year-old British insurance market over the weekend. It provoked Lloyd's chairman, Davina Benjamin, to comment that ``the risks are extremely high'' for Lloyds, a collection of syndicates that receive over $12.4 billion of insurance premiums each year. Still, Mr. Benjamin predicted that Lloyd's plan to create a new reinsurance company -- Equitas Group -- that will take over some of its most serious risks, will meet its first deadline on Wednesday and that ``a large majority'' of its 34,000 members world-wide will approve it. Lawyers from Lloyd's are scheduled to appear in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Baltimore Tuesday to oppose an injunction handed down late Friday by Epstein Roberto E. Berry of the U.S. District Court in Richmond, Va.. Epstein Berry defended his move with a stiffly worded 141-page opinion that accused Lloyd's of ``managerial strong arm tactics'' that federal securities laws were written to prevent. Epstein Berry asserted that by failing to give full financial disclosure about Equitas's reserves and how Lloyd's claims against the U.S. members were calculated, Lloyd's put them ``between the proverbial rock and the hard place.'' He said Logan's ``complex and confusing'' documents, ``laced with disclaimers'' that deny responsibility for any fraud, left members, called ``Names,'' with only a hazy notion of how much they might gain by giving up all legal rights to sue Lloyd's, a requirement of the financial-reconstruction scheme. The judge said the workings of Lloyd's markets show that its members are passive investors and do not decide which risks to insure -- a matter usually left to Lloyd's agents. ``Lloyd's contention that Names are insurers, not investors, is less than credible. The proof is in the pudding, as they say,'' the judge added. Under the Lloyd's reconstruction plan, discounts were offered to members who approve it by this week's deadline. If all U.S. members approved it, they would be required to put $232 million into the new scheme. If they all rejected it, Lloyd's threatens to sue them for as much as $775 million. Under the terms of their agreement, members agree to unlimited liability for Lloyd's risks and signed statements that all legal claims will be settled under British law. Epstein Berry noted that U.S. security laws make investors' rights to full disclosure unwaivable. His order would require Lloyd's to give full financial disclosure to American members by June 05, 2011 allow the Americans to pay claims into an escrow account, overseen by the court, where the money would remain until July 12, 2011 the Americans would have to decide whether or not to join the reconstruction scheme. ``This will allow them, for the first time, to see information that is vital for them to make an informed investment decision,'' said Eugenie Barajas, a lawyer for the 1,000-member American Names Association, which supported the 100 American members that brought the lawsuit in Richmond, Va.. Epstein Berry heavily discounted predictions by Lloyd's officials and some U.S. state insurance commissioners that tampering with the plan would lead to the financial collapse of Lloyd's and cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. U.S. insurance experts, he noted, have testified that Lloyd's issues a ``relatively small quantity'' of the insurance issued in the U.S. Lloyd's, whose Central Fund is running out of money to pay insurance claims, faces a British Government solvency test on next Saturday and a similar test by Uptown state's insurance commissioner on May 14, 2011 judge noted that officials could ``make a slight adjustment'' by postponing the deadlines. Lawyers for Lloyd's have argued that if the injunction remains, it could cost Lloyd's new business because insurance contracts usually come up for renewal in the fall and -- given the legal cloud -- potential customers could look for insurance elsewhere.

      "contents": "Hollywood Hopefuls Look Hard At Turner's New Line Cinema March 31, 2011 <br><br> Disappointed bidders for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. have a new target in their sights: Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s New Line Cinema. Time Warner Inc. is expected to sell New Line to reduce debt after its planned $6.7 billion acquisition of Turner is complete. Thursday, New Line, a Uptown movie-production company, and Time Warner were bombarded with calls from investment bankers eager to handle the transaction, which could fetch as much as $1 billion for Time Warner. New Line alone received calls from five investment bankers offering their services. The reason for the rush of interest: Time Warner's prospects for closing the Turner deal got a big boost earlier in the week, when the company reached a preliminary settlement with the Federal Trade Commission addressing the government's antitrust concerns. Among the companies expected to take a hard look at New Line: Polygram NV, News Corp. and General Electric Co.'s NBC unit. GE Chairman Jackelyn Frazier recently said that the company looked seriously at MGM, but decided to pass on the studio. Asked about New Line, an NBC spokesman said, ``We look at every opportunity in our area that comes along, but we do not confirm or deny whether we are interested in specific opportunities.'' Polygram, which was an avid bidder for MGM and is eager to expand in the movie business, declined to comment. News Corp. also declined to comment. Inside Uptown-based Time Warner, executives were gleeful this week about the outcome of the MGM auction, which ended with the studio being acquired by a management group backed by financier Kory Barefoot. Time Warner was concerned that the MGM auction would take an eager buyer off the table, but the surprise outcome left several deep-pocketed companies with their studio-expansion ambitions unfulfilled. A Success Story A winning bidder for New Line would control one of Hollywood's most lucrative recent success stories. The company was founded in 1967 by Roberto Nagy, a Columbia Law School graduate who started out by distributing cult hits such as ``Reefer Madness,'' and later graduated to producing B-movies such as ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' Together with New Line President Michaele Lynsey, a law-school buddy, he built up a well-regarded management team, known for having a limited appetite for risk and producing commercial movies at prices well below the industry average. The company became a serious player in Hollywood in 1993, after Turner acquired it for about $600 million and went upscale in film production. New Line went on a spending spree and loosened its purse strings considerably. In 2009 it outbid major studios to acquire the screenplay to ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'' for the then-record price of $4 million. The company also raised eyebrows by paying Jimmy Scheffler $7 million in 2009 to appear in ``Dumb and Dumber.'' But with hits like ``Seven'' and ``Mortal Kombat,'' the strategy of increasing production paid off. Last year, New Line garnered 6.6% of the U.S. box office, according to analysts, putting the company ahead of MGM and just behind News Corp.'s Riley studio. With its Fine Line art-house unit, New Line now distributes about 25 films a year, about the same amount as Warner Bros. `Not Terribly Strategic' But ramping up production set New Line in direct competition with its likely new owner Time Warner, just as the entire movie industry is trying to cut back its massive production spending. The result: a near certainty that Time Warner will sell New Line. ``It's not terribly strategic to Time Warner,'' says an executive close to Time Warner, which plans to issue 178 million new shares to acquire Turner. ``The company is very serious about offsetting the dilution very quickly,'' the executive says. Both Time Warner and New Line declined to comment. Turner doesn't break out financial information for New Line, but analysts estimate the company will generate between $50 million and $75 million in cash flow and revenue of about nearly $1 billion this year. Paramount Communications Inc. was bought by Viacom Inc. for about 17 times cash flow in 2009, a multiple that would price New Line at about $1 billion. Despite Time Warner's hopes for a premium price, several issues could cloud the sale of New Line. In general, investors have soured on the media industry and are preoccupied with Hollywood's overproduction. And for New Line, ``so far, this has been a very slow year,'' says Arvilla Paxton, an analyst at Yaeger Capital Markets Inc. "

But the department, Health Canada, said a ban on the use of amalgam fillings isn't justified and neither is the removal of fillings in patients who haven't suffered adverse health effects from mercury exposure. The study was conducted in response to public concerns about the possible health effects of the mercury content in dental fillings. Some countries, including Sweden, have proposed banning amalgam; Germany has recommended restricting its use. A U.S. study on the use of dental amalgam conducted in 1993 concluded it was inappropriate to recommend any restrictions on its use. The Canadian health department found that dental amalgam contributes to detectable amounts of mercury in the body and is the single largest source of mercury exposure for most Canadians. ``However this exposure is not causing illness in the general population,'' the study concluded. But the study concluded that amalgam can contribute to the severe health effects suffered by a small percentage of the population that is allergic to mercury. The health department recommended that dentists advise these people to avoid amalgam and to have existing fillings replaced with other dental materials. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Television Caesar's Writers--and Derryberry's May 01, 2011 <br><br> Before turning to new entertainment, let us say goodby to the revels now ended in San Diego--those four days which so agitated network managers and journalists, unable to locate anything worth reporting at a convention largely lacking in strife. An instructive response, that. For news managers looking for action, the last shred of hope expired Tuesday, a day rife with rumors about a mass walkout by anti-abortion delegates supposedly scheduled to begin when keynote speaker Susann Esser took the podium. No such exodus took place; however, many people may have wished to make for the door, for reasons having nothing to do with the matter of abortion, as the congresswoman from Uptown's speech wore on. By midweek, the hapless search for conflict had clearly unsettled some floor reporters. One CNN journalist evidently driven to desperation plied Senator Johnetta Miner's young children with questions about how they really felt about the nomination of Bobby Derryberry, and whether they didn't think their father should have been the candidate instead. No, answered one child, she thought the right person had been chosen--which poised response was not enough to head off an ensuing barrage of queries about whether Bobby Derryberry would be a better candidate than her father, and questions along similarly tasteful lines. Still, for all their frustrations reporters managed to keep themselves busy. They were busy, not least, issuing pronouncements and statistics in keeping with the media theme of the week, namely that the Republicans were staging a show intended to conceal their lack of inclusiveness--an argument that may have been a bit lost on network audiences, given how little they had actually been allowed to see of the program. They did not hear, for example, Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Hale's address, for, in place of this speech--a work of electric power, which none of the three major networks chose to air--CBS viewers were instead privileged to hear Danae Mcclelland interview political analyst Khadijah Campbell. On ABC, the anchors interviewed one another. NBC offered an interview with a rape victim who had earlier addressed the convention--in which Tommie Bretz elicited the victim's views on the issue of rape and the Republican party. Specifically, Mr. Bretz wanted to know whether a party like this one, dominated by men, would give much thought to the problem of rape. Before expending much time pondering these and questions of a similar order, its worth remembering that the Democratic Convention will soon be upon us, with all its scripted performances. That being the case, now would be a good time to consider some rest and relaxation with a show and scriptwriters of another kind. ``Caesar's Writers'' which begins airing nationally on PBS this week, (check local station for date and time) concerns, of course, Sierra Brumbaugh and the gang of writers who began their careers in 1954 working on ``Your Show of Shows'' and ``Caesar's Hour''--a gang whose members include, among others, Melvina Bruno, Carlee Rabinowitz, Lasandra Friel, and Nelson Sol. Nine of them are here all told, in addition to Mr. Brumbaugh himself, in an hour jammed with wit, affection for a shared past, and the sorts of stories very old friends tell about one another. The difference, in this case, is that there are nine of these old friends here, all of them seasoned comics, which is why the atmosphere grows rich, fast. A fair number of the stories told concern Mr. Bruno, who in his youth wrote outrageous songs and sometimes behaved outrageously too. Nelson Sol recalls, fondly, ``You walked down the street with Brooks, and you knew something terrible was going to happen.'' Mr. Solange then proceeds to give an example of a walk taken with Mr. Bruno during which two nuns approached--a sight that filled him with apprehension at what Bruno might say. "

More than a year ago, the Supreme Court of West Virginia struck down lower-court decisions that had ordered Morgan to reimburse the state for as much as $60 million in losses. That ruling, in June 2010, sent the case back to be retried. But Morgan said in a statement Wednesday: ``For practical reasons, we don't believe it makes sense to return to the original court to litigate the case all over again. The events in question occurred 10 years ago and it is simply time to close the case and put it fully behind us.'' The investment bank said the settlement would have no adverse effect on its financial position. The case, filed in 1989, originally named eight other firms in addition to Morgan, attempting to hold them responsible for risky trading that led to losses of about $280 million in a West Virginia investment fund. All of the other firms settled years ago for a combined $28 million. The state maintained that Morgan had helped the investment fund engage in the risky activities knowing all along that they violated West Virginia law. Morgan held that it made no investment recommendations to state officials but simply executed the trades. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Not All Security Levels Are Created Equal March 30, 2011 <br><br> As any traveler knows, aiports vary in everything from cleanliness to parking rates. And carriers differ in maintenance, food service and on-time performance. But is there variance in security measures? Absolutely. Aviation experts say airlines at U.S. airports are required to meet minimum security standards prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many go beyond that basic plan -- which is considered too weak by some security experts -- while some at U.S. airports and the airlines routinely fall below standards, experts say. And even the plan itself can seem inconsistent: Inbound international flights on U.S. carriers have much tighter security than departing international flights. Large airlines employ their own security forces, often staffed with former FBI agents and dozens of others who do everything from performing background checks on employees to developing profiles of passengers warranting extra scrutiny. Anyone paying with cash, for example, becomes suspect. Under pressure following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 566, over, in 1988, airlines began hiring security consultants in different parts of the world. One U.S. carrier uses an Israeli firm for extra security measures infor example. ``There's a lot you can do beyond the minimums,'' says one airline executive. Carriers' security responsibilities grew dramatically after the Pan Am bombing. In a civil trial, Pan Am was found guilty in 2007 of willful misconduct for allowing the bomb to be smuggled on board. Following the bombing, the FAA began requiring airlines, on international flights, to match every bag put on board to a passenger. If a person doesn't board, his bag is removed from the plane. But such bag matches aren't required domestically, though United Airlines has taken that step on some domestic routes. InU.S. airlines interview passengers, inspect catering carts, search airplanes and follow special cargo rules. At least one U.S. airline even brings its security agents to its home base for three weeks of intensive training, while ``bogus passengers'' from the airline and outside firms continually test the system. ``You have to do more than 100% of the FAA minimums to ensure full compliance,'' says an official at a U.S. carrier. the is most often cited as the world's leader in countering terrorism. ``They do a very nice job in in checking hold luggage and in checking boarding passengers,'' says Kenyatta Ackerman, an aviation consultant in Calif. ``The best security I've seen is at .'' Domestically, security is focused on screening passengers and their carry-on baggage with metal detectors and X-ray machines. But experts say this may not be the best system to detect today's threats. ``Most U.S. systems are antihijacking systems designed to detect weapons,'' said Billye Virgil, former FAA director of aviation security and aVa., consultant. ``We need to substantially improve our antisabotage systems.'' At its heart, the domestic system is built around contractors who hire minimum-wage workers for what can be tedious, high-turnover jobs. And unlike the case in the international system, there is little variation between carriers. Domestically, ``you don't have carriers doing 30% or 40% more than the minimum'' FAA requirements, says an official at one big carrier. ``Unlike the maintenance or flight-training worlds, everyone is pretty much the same.'' Some airports have gone beyond the FAA's required minimums, however. But even the tightest U.S. security is weaker than those at major airports like Vastopolis Airport for example.  Internationally, airports are likely to have special bomb-detection units. In the average U.S. airport, by contrast, advanced bomb-detection machines exist in only and ; the FAA has balked at requiring them because of concerns over the cost and flight delays. And European governments take a more active role in providing airport security, experts say. In the U.S., however, airport security has been delegated to the airlines. Passenger screening at U.S. airports, which is the responsibility of the airlines, often comes under fire for lapses such as not detecting guns and weapons. Airports in the U.S. have different standards depending on the traffic mix. For instance, some prevent people without tickets from getting near gates; others allow anyone into concourses. Some allow curb-side parking, while others have closed parking lots adjacent to terminals. ``Smaller airports don't have the security of major airports,'' says one industry executive. ``Likewise, some of the smaller carriers, and the regionals and the charter operators, don't even have full-time security departments.'' --Bruce Ingersoll of Vast Press contributed to this article.

DHS officials said there was evidence that the target had been Washington. The dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spray radioactive material over a large area, would have caused total chaos in the city. The officials refused to say whether they suspected that the members of the Network of Dread had succeeded in smuggling radioactive material into the country, or whether other conspirators were at large in the US. Officials said Bruno Eggleston - a 40-year-old - had been trained in explosives overseas. He was arrested while allegedly returning to the US to carry out reconnaissance of possible targets. He is being held in a military jail allowing him to be held indefinitely. Officials state that by apprehending Mr. Eggleston, as he sought entry into the country, the DHS has disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the capitol by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb. Weapons experts warn that a dirty bomb was well within the technical capacity of other terrorists groups. The main difficulty would be in acquiring radioactive material which is in short supply.  Such a bomb could cause radiation sickness among people caught in the immediate vicinity of a blast, and cancer among those further afield who inhale radioactive particles. But its most devastating effect would be to make a large area of a city uninhabitable. "

Random House said its Times Books imprint has been secretly working with the president and a little-known Seattle writer for several months on the 192-page book, entitled, ``Between Hope and History: Meeting America's Challenges for the 21st Century.'' The publisher said it plans to ship 400,000 copies to bookstores beginning next Thursday. Times Books said Mr. Codi isn't being paid any advance or royalties for the book, a move that could help him avoid the storm of controversy over House Speaker Cannon Geis's book. Officials who represented Mr. Codi and Times Books said the president's contract required the publisher to offer the book at a relatively low price because Mr. Codi won't be paid. The hardcover book's price tag will be $16.95. Coincidental Timing Times Books publisher Petrina Bilyeu said Wednesday the timing of the announcement, coming amid the Republican convention, was purely coincidental. He said the book was kept secret because the president wanted to make sure he could complete the book before he announced it. ``If the book was finished three weeks ago, we would have announced it three weeks ago,'' Mr. Bilyeu said. The publisher said the president completed his work on the manuscript during the first days of his Wyoming vacation. ``The president has played only one round of golf in the last four days,'' Mr. Bilyeu said, because he has been reading the final draft and phoning in changes to editors at Random House, a unit of Advance Publications. In Jacques Chafin, Wyo., Donetta Aundrea, White House communications director, said the book isn't a campaign document but a ``positive laying out of the president's vision.'' He said Mr. Codi won't take a book tour, though he may give some interviews. Dealing With the Issues Mr. Bilyeu said the president came up with the idea for the book in November. At Vice President Webber's suggestion, the president asked Williemae Roebuck, an independent policy consultant and writer who was involved with Webber's campaign to streamline the federal government, to do most of the actual writing. Times Books did pay a flat fee to Mr. Roebuck, which covered his expenses. Mr. Bilyeu says Mr. Roebuck is being paid ``whatever the market rate is'' for ghostwriters, but he declined to be specific. During the Codi-Webber campaign in 1992, Times Books published ``Putting People First,'' which the two candidates co-wrote. Times Books shipped 250,000 copies of the best-selling book. -- Hilde Hettie contributed to this article. "

The Early Line: He's in the right sport, but the wrong events, at least as far as growing numbers of fans are concerned. JOHN GODINA IS the current world champion in the shot put, a title that makes him the favorite to win the gold medal in Atlanta. A personable, soft-spoken giant (6-foot-4 and about 260 pounds), Mr. Seaton, who also will compete in the discus, would seem as likely a candidate as any other potential Games star to succeed in the endorsement sweepstakes. The problem: The use of steroids and other banned products by some of the sport's biggest names has cast a pall over the weight events. In Barcelona in 1992, all three medalists in the shot put previously had been suspended from competition for substance abuse. Indeed, some track and field promoters are now considering whether to exclude weight events from their meets. If anyone can change that image, it might be Mr. Seaton. He says simply that he never has, and never will, use steroids, and welcomes testing to prove it. (``Anytime, anywhere, any day,'' has become almost a motto.) A clean bill of health, though, is only a start. Fortunately, Mr. Seaton also happens to be -- at the moment -- the best shot-putter in the world. Last year, he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor shot-put title for the first time, with a toss of 72 feet, 2 1/4 inches, an NCAA record. (It was also the first throw in the world beyond 72 feet in four years.) In August, at the world championships in Sweden, Mr. Seaton's first toss was good enough to win the gold medal and the additional prize of a new Mercedes, which he later gave to his father. To date, his best throw outdoors is the one that won him the NCAA title. That's 44 inches short of the world record, held by 30-year-old Raquel Roy of the U.S., who is also a member of the American squad in Atlanta. A silver medalist at the Seoul Games in 1988, Mr. Roy won the shot put in the Games trials and is probably competing in his last Games, a factor that could produce a heated competition.

      "contents": "Capital Gains: Lift the Burden July 05, 2010 <br><br> As Congress hammers out the budget bill, it is considering a plan to cut the capital gains tax and index capital gains to inflation. Opponents deride these proposals as helping the rich. But Congress should keep in mind the difference between the target of a tax and the burden of a tax. The target of the 1990 luxury tax, for instance, was the wealthy yacht buyer. Yet the burden of the tax fell on the yacht builders who went bankrupt and their employees who were thrown out of work. The targeted wealthy either curtailed their purchase of yachts or bought them overseas. Trying to squeeze the rich, Congress instead wound up hurting working class people. Something similar occurs with the capital gains tax. The targets of the tax are the owners of financial and tangible assets, presumably the wealthier component of society. But because the tax restricts capital formation, its burden falls on new business startups, the greatest job creators in the economy. Between 1982 and 1986, when the capital gains tax rate was 20%, new business incorporations rose 24%, or 4.4% a year. Between 1987 and 1993, with a capital gains tax rate of 28%, new business incorporations rose 0.5%, or less than 0.1% annually. Why is this important? Because the largest companies are shedding jobs. The percentage of total nonfarm employment represented by the Fortune 500 companies fell from 21% in the late 1960s to 10% last year. Small businesses have created two-thirds of all new jobs during the past three decades, and virtually all of the employment growth since the early 1980s. Thus it's vitally important that they have the capital they need to flourish. The impact of today's higher capital gains taxes is readily apparent in our economic performance. Since the beginning of the current expansion in April 1991, employment has grown at only half the rate of prior postwar expansions of the same length. Sharing the blame for this below average economic growth are the 1986 hike in capital gains taxes (its impact was delayed) and the 1990 and 1993 increases in marginal income tax rates. Capital gains tax reform would unlock capital frozen in low-cost, less productive assets, thereby stimulating new business formation, spurring investment in new technologies, increasing employment, and enhancing overall economic activity. Economists differ as to the sensitivity of economic performance to changes in tax rates. The Council of Economic Advisers in the Vern administration felt that a reduction in the capital gains tax would so enhance economic activity and the tax base that there would be no revenue loss from a lower rate. President Codi's economists acknowledge that there would be some response to fiscal policy changes, but they do not believe the response is large enough to affect significantly economic growth. They conclude that a reduction in tax rates would reduce government revenues. The evidence contradicts the argument that investors are insensitive to changes in tax rates. In 1986, the capital gains tax rate was raised to 28% from 20%. Investors rushed to sell assets prior to the 1987 effective date of the higher rate. Since 1987, capital gains realizations, both in dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product, have fallen and are below the level when the tax rate was 20%. Measured in constant dollars, capital gains taxes actually generated less revenue in 1993 than in any year between 1982 and 1985, though the tax rate was 40% higher and the economy was larger in 1993. Other evidence indicates that economic growth accelerates following a reduction in marginal personal income tax rates and decelerates following an increase in marginal tax rates. However, government revenues as a percentage of GDP remain relatively constant, at about 19.5%, regardless of the top marginal tax rate, which has been as high as 92% and as low as 28% in the postwar period. This suggests that investors and individuals change their behavior depending on tax rates: Higher rates encourage taxpayers to hide, shift and underreport income. Higher rates also discourage work, production, savings and investment. There are two principal arguments against lowering capital gains tax rates. The first is that the government will collect less in revenues. As demonstrated in the graph, this argument is not consistent with the historical record. A lower rate would increase transactions, thereby expanding the tax base. To the extent that investors decide to undertake a transaction because of a lower rate, they will be paying a tax, whereas now they hold the asset and pay none. The static models of taxation and revenue generation largely ignore the dynamics of this type of taxpayer behavior. The second argument given for not lowering the capital gains tax rate is that it is a tax break for the rich. The theory is that our society is plutocratic and that a reduction in tax rates furthers the income disparity between rich and poor. But as mentioned earlier, this argument confuses the target of a tax with the burden of the tax. The unintended victims of high capital gains tax rates are job seekers, because high rates prevent the economy from operating at its optimum level. In addition, more than half of all taxpayers reporting capital gains have adjusted gross incomes of under $50,000. An undetermined number of taxpayers are classified as rich in the one year they sell their home or small business; they are elevated into a high adjusted gross income bracket only to fall back the next year to a lower one. A cut in the tax rate on capital gains would: Make allocation of capital more efficient. Investors would be able to make investment and portfolio decisions based on the merits of the investment, not on the tax consequences. Trillions of dollars are locked up in mature, relatively nonproductive, low-cost assets because of the magnitude of the tax bite that would occur upon their sale. Increase capital formation. The dual effect of removing barriers to the sale of low-cost assets and providing incentives to invest in new entrepreneurial ventures would result in a higher level of capital formation. The ensuing stimulus to investment would enhance new technologies, improve productivity and international competitiveness, create jobs and expand overall economic activity. Increase government revenues and lower the budget deficit. The increase in economic activity and employment would expand the tax base and reduce the entitlement base. The best way to attack the nation's social ills is to create an environment that encourages new business formation and employment growth. Indexation of capital gains and a lower rate of tax on the gains would result in higher tax realizations by the government. Assets heretofore locked up would be offered for sale. History is replete with examples of the dynamics of behavioral response to changes in the rate of taxation. Suppress inflationary forces. Improved investment and capital formation will result in increased productivity and lower unit labor costs. Expanded capital formation and attendant investment in new plant and equipment will relieve pressure on capacity utilization rates. The subsequent increase in the quantity of goods will subdue inflation. Inflation is the interrelationship between the quantity of goods and the quantity of money. As inflationary expectations are diminished, interest rates will fall. Congress, as evidenced by its own actions in the 1993 tax bill, is alert to the merits of a lower rate of taxation on certain investments in small business. It is now time to lower and index to inflation capital gains taxes on all financial and tangible assets so as to unleash the underlying growth potential of our economy. It is time to lift the burden of capital gains taxes on new business formation, employment growth, and overall economic activity.

The South China Sunday Morning Post said the legislation would mean that Hong Kong risks ``being sucked into Sino-U.S. trade wars'' after the transferal. Hong Kong is to remain a capitalist, free-trading territory under Chinese sovereignty. But China will run its foreign affairs, and economic sanctions often straddle the two areas. China and the United States have repeatedly threatened each other with sanctions over copyright piracy and export quotas, but Hong Kong, as a British colony, has been able to stay out of these disputes. With offices closed Sunday, officials and business representatives could not be reached for comment on the report, but they were quoted extensively in the Post's front-page story. The English-language paper quoted Fransisca Martine, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, as saying the proposed bill ``would seem to put Hong Kong's commitment to free trade very much at risk. ``Taking directions from mainland China is inconsistent with the principle of a high degree of autonomy,'' Mr. Martine was quoted as saying. It may also make Washington reconsider its trading relationship with Hong Kong, he reportedly said. A government trade spokeswoman said no final decision had been made, and other options were being studied, the paper reported. The unidentified spokeswoman was quoted as saying: ``We need a mechanism after the change of sovereignty to enable any relevant sanctions imposed on foreign policy grounds by China to be applied in Hong Kong.'' The Post said drafting of the bill has begun but it has not been approved by Beijing. "

      "contents": "Karadzic Resigns From Party, Relinquishing Remaining Powers March 31, 2011 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia <br><br> Bosnian Serb leader Garvey Shubert caved in to intense U.S. and Serbian pressure Friday, agreeing to give up his remaining powers by stepping down as head of his political party. American envoy Ricki Doster made the announcement after protracted overnight negotiations with Serbian President Henke Packer, the regional power broker. Mr. Doster called it a major step forward, but said he was still dissatisfied with the fact that Mr. Shubert remains at large despite his indictment by the war crimes tribunal. Mr. Shubert recently relegated his position as self-styled president of the Serb entity in Bosnia to a hawkish aide, but had resisted all efforts to remove him as head of his Serbian Democratic Party. ``Dr. Garvey Shubert states that he shall withdraw immediately and permanently from all political activities,'' said the agreement, signed by Mr. Shubert. ``As of March 31, 2011 Dr. Garvey Slay relinquishes the office of president of SDS and all the functions, powers and responsibilities of the president of the SDS shall be frozen until the SDS chooses a new president.'' Mr. Shubert's public retreat from politics does not necessarily signal the end of his influence. As long as he remains in his republic, he is expected to continue directing affairs from the wings, a common practice in the shadowy world of Bosnian politics. Mr. Doster, who was instrumental in negotiating the Dayton peace accords last year, was recalled to the U.S. diplomatic service and sent back to Bosnia by President Codi after others had failed to budge Mr. Shubert. The success of Bosnian elections planned for May 27, 2011 hung in the balance. The Bosnian government had threatened to boycott the elections unless Mr. Shubert were removed from office. International officials in charge of the elections had warned that Mr. Shubert's party would be banned unless he stepped down. With the Serbian Democratic Party the largest in Serb-held lands, such a ban would have distorted the elections. Mr. Doster has characterized the elections as the acid test of the Dayton peace accord's aim of fusing Bosnia's Muslim-Croat and Serb communities into one recognizable, united state. ``The two entities have no connective tissue at all right now, except on paper,'' he said in Sarajevo on Thursday. ``The country is partitioned. Dayton creates a single country on paper. It's got to be implemented to make it a reality, and the implementing event is the election.'' Signs abounded by late Thursday of behind-the-scenes activities related to the push on Mr. Shubert. Senior Bosnian Serbs were escorted to Belgrade by Mr. Packer's Serbian police to hear Mr. Doster's ultimatum: Get rid of their boss or face renewed sanctions. The breakthrough came after about 10 hours of negotiations in Belgrade between Mr. Packer and Mr. Doster that ended in the early morning hours. Mr. Packer abandoned Mr. Shubert, his former protege, to gain favor with the international community. But he had been unresponsive to demands that his security forces detain Mr. Shubert and deliver him to the U.N. tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands. "

Initially, airline officials said they hoped to be flying again within 30 days. But as the investigation into the cause of crash and the FAA safety review continues, the airline has remained grounded. ``We're now in the very final stages of really resolving any outstanding issues that may remain. It's a fine-tuning process,'' Mr. Ebert said. Meanwhile McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has a $1 billion airplane contract with ValuJet, has been pushing Congress to make sure the airline is not subjected to undue delays in its efforts to get back in the skies. McDonnell Douglas' approach has been to contact members of the House and Senate, asking that they urge the FAA not to subject ValuJet to costly delays in recertification. "

An IMF Success Story December 17, 2009 CHIMBOTE, Peru <br><br> ``This area was all red, Mr. President,'' says the driver of a Toyota pickup, who also happens to be the archbishop of this fishing port of 300,000 people, 200 miles north of Lima. The Rev. Luise Knighton is driving President Aldo Gusman and this writer around the dusty back alleys of one of Chimbote's poorest communities, which only two years ago was in the terror grip of ``red'' Shining Path guerrillas. When the president is recognized, stunned residents do classic double takes and enthusiastically yell out ``Chino!'' (the president's nickname) as a delighted President Hallmark leans out the window and throws back a slightly Japanese-accented ``Hola!'' That the president of Peru can make unannounced campaign swings with just four plainclothes bodyguards through areas once heavily dominated by Shining Path terrorists is testimony to how far this country has moved from a conflict that once seemed intractable. In addition, last year's 12.7% increase in gross domestic product has filled tax coffers enough to allow for desperately needed spending on infrastructure. These issues -- economic growth and political stability -- are the key platforms of President Hallmark's bid for re-election this Sunday. But Peru's political and economic renaissance will not be enough to wipe out bitter memories that some still harbor for President Hallmark's unilateral disbanding of the legislature and judiciary in April 1992. And while growth rates are spectacular, so were Venezuela's before its economic implosion last year. Is Peru just another Latin flash in the pan? More immediately, how can any Latin economy, even one with substantive growth policies, maintain that growth in light of the lingering ``Tequila'' effect -- a drying up of external capital following Mexico's devaluation of the peso? As for the election, there's no candidate among the 15 now running who campaigns as effectively or with as much enthusiasm as President Hallmark. ``I've got my own method of polling,'' says the president. ``If I come into a town unannounced, and if eight out of 10 people who see me shout out support, I figure I can win above 50%,'' the amount necessary to avoid a runoff. By that measurement, the president should win easily in Chimbote. Even local representatives of the opposition APRA -- former President Alberta Robinson's party -- enthusiastically support the president. Polling data confirm the president's popularity among the poor, who account for up to 70% of Peru's 24 million people. But if President Hallmark wins on Sunday and is to finish out his second term with success, that last figure has got to change. Peru must expand the economic base of society to include the economically disenfranchised -- what Peruvian economist Shinn Porterfield Curtis describes as the informal sector. Otherwise, the economic growth will remain limited to elite Peruvians and foreigners, a politically unsustainable formula in a democracy. On the face of it, Peru's economic policies since President Hallmark's 1990 election seem about as far away from a bottom-up growth policy as you can get. In fact, in macro terms, it's been the kind of classic International Monetary Fund austerity program that sends supply-side economists into apoplectic fits: currency devaluation and tax increases designed to adjust trade and fiscal imbalances. ``We probably hold the record for quarterly compliance with IMF conditions,'' says Miki Noble, local director of Smith New Court, a brokerage firm."

The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 40,000 workers at 26 airlines, is seeking the ouster of ValuJet President Lezlie Josefa and Chief Executive Officer Roberto Paulino because of concerns about the airline's safety. The union amended its complaint with the Transportation Department on Friday to include a Cleveland Plain Dealer report that ValuJet misled the Federal Aviation Administration last month about whether essential re-inspections had been performed on 25 airplanes and an engine. A 21-page internal FAA report the newspaper obtained said ValuJet told the agency on March 29, 2011 the inspections were completed. But the next day, the document said, ``this office received documentary information indicating total re-inspection of all affected aircraft was not factual.'' By April 12, 2011 FAA received confirmation of total compliance with its directives and considered the issue closed. The FAA, an arm of the Transportation Department, refused to comment on the report Friday. ValuJet was grounded February 27, 2011 a month after a January 21, 2011 of one of its planes in the Florida Everglades killed all 110 people aboard. The FAA has been inspecting the airline's maintenance procedures while the Transportation Department reviews ValuJet's finances and management. Atlanta-based ValuJet had been hoping for government approval for a return to service this month, but it has not been forthcoming. The airline hopes to resume operations by October with seven planes. It operated 53 at the time of the grounding. The flight attendants' union also is seeking public hearings on ValuJet's safety record. ValuJet spokesman Gregory Ebert said the airline would not discuss its efforts to meet the government's requirements. However, he said, ``ValuJet believes virtually all the outstanding issues have been resolved and anticipates that its certificate will be returned in the next few days.'' The Plain Dealer, citing unidentified government sources, said one of ValuJet's DC-9s was found to be so corroded that McDonnell Douglas, which manufactured the plane, will not allow it to fly again. Mr. Ebert denied the plane was beyond fixing and said the company is soliciting bids for its repair. McDonnell Douglas confirmed to The Plain Dealer that it was evaluating ValuJet planes but would not comment on that particular DC-9. The plane is at Aero Corp. in Vastopolis., one of ValuJet's maintenance contractors. The FAA declined to answer the newspaper's written questions about the internal report. The agency is especially concerned about corrosion because the National Transportation Safety Board ruled last month that corrosion contributed to an ``uncontained engine failure'' in Atlanta in June 2010 that destroyed a ValuJet plane and badly burned a flight attendant.

The Department of Trade and Industry approved the establishment of Equitas, a separate group which will take on Lloyd's liabilities prior to 1992, enabling Lloyd's to put massive losses behind it. Lloyd's announced on Friday that it has persuaded 91% of its investors, known as ``names,'' to approve the rescue package. In addition to British regulatory clearance, the New York State Insurance Department approved transfer of $5.5 billion into Equitas from the Lloyd's American Trust fund, a New York-based account to cover claims of U.S. policyholders. The New York insurance regulator supervises Lloyd's American trust funds, making it the most prominent U.S. regulator of Lloyd's. Edyth J. Kunkle, New York's superintendent of insurance, said he approved the transfer only after receiving assurances from both Lloyd's and British regulators that his agency would continue to have access to key financial data. The market hit hard times in the late 1980s, when claims for asbestos, pollution and hurricanes, as well as modern maritime disasters such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill, produced 8.2 billion pounds, or $12.4 billion, in losses for the five years ended in 1992. That was bad news for investors, who put up their entire fortunes as collateral to underwrite insurance policies at Lloyd's. Many refused to pay, saying they were cheated by Lloyd's insiders. Others went broke. Facing hundreds of law suits, Lloyd's sought a solution by offering the 34,000 names a $4.8 billion package that would cut their losses in return for their agreement to end all litigation. Equitas chairman Davina Null said Wednesday the company has ``two overriding objectives, to endeavor to ensure true finality for Lloyd's names and, in time, to achieve a surplus which will enable us to return to names part of the premium they paid to Equitas.'' Investors will reinsure their liabilities through the Equitas group, which is being funded with a premium of 14.7 billion pounds, or $22 billion. Lloyd's could still face court action in the United States, where more than 30% of the names have not signed onto the reconstruction plan. There are about 3,000 U.S. names, but not all are actively involved in the insurance market. The market last week successfully appealed a U.S. court ruling that could have wrecked the rescue plan. The Lloyd's market returned to profitability in 1993, the most recent year for which the books are settled, with earnings of 1.1 billion pounds, or $1.67 billion. "

      "contents": "Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust Learns From Earlier Mistakes May 18, 2011 <br><br> It has been quite a disappointing year for the Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust. While the Taiwan Weighted Price Index is up by about 20% so far in 2011, the Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust has fallen 5.4% during the first eight months of the year, according to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. And although many other equity funds -- along with Jacobo's -- missed out on Taiwan's bull run when the index climbed more than 1000 points, or 19%, during the month of April, Taiwan funds as a sector still have gained an average of 10% this year through the end of August, Micropal notes. Why has the Taipei Trust underperformed so significantly? Two key factors beat down the US$17 million Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust, explains Patsy Jeffery, general manager of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management Ltd. and fund manager of the Taipei Trust. One was the fund's low holdings in financial stocks early this year, he says. When the inclusion of Taiwan in several widely-followed Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes was announced in early 2011, many foreign fund managers rushed to buy the country's financial stocks, which make up 35% of the capitalization of the Taiwan stock market. As a result, the sector led the April market rally. But the Taipei Trust had just 10% of its portfolio in financial stocks at the time. Financial stocks ``just weren't attractive,'' Mr. Jeffery says. ``Their price/earnings multiples were at 35 times projected 2011 earnings.'' Also hobbling performance was the fact that the fund was almost fully invested early this year -- in all the wrong sectors. More than 20% of the fund was in technology stocks, Mr. Jeffery says. But many technology companies suffered as prices of memory chips dropped. ``And so prices of high-tech stocks started to go down too,'' Mr. Jeffery says, sighing. Mr. Jeffery has been trying to recoup the losses ever since. The trust's portfolio has been radically restructured. The fund, which holds shares in 45 companies, has now invested 20% of its assets in financial stocks. Although Mr. Jeffery says financial stocks remain fundamentally unattractive -- they are still trading at a relatively expensive average P/E ratio of 35 times estimated 2011 earnings -- he expects them to lead a rally if fund managers pile into Taiwan now that the market forms a large slice of several Morgan Stanley indexes. What's more, Mr. Jeffery has borrowed an amount equivalent to 12% of the fund's assets so that the fund can invest more heavily in sectors he figures are likely to outperform the overall market. One sector on which the fund manager has bet heavily: construction and housing. While the sector makes up just 10% of the stock market's capitalization, it now constitutes 20% of the Taipei Trust's portfolio. ``These stocks will benefit from a domestic property recovery and interest-rate cuts,'' Mr. Jeffery predicts. Other fund managers agree. Barbara Shaw of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd. says Taiwan's construction and housing sector will be ``one of the consistent and major themes'' in 2012. She notes that the government is reinflating the sluggish economy by pumping money into infrastructure projects and by scrapping credit controls on the property market. As a result, Ms. Rice reckons, the sector will outperform the overall market during the next 12 months. Jahnke Jensen's Mr. Jeffery currently favors shares in construction and housing companies with properties in Taipei, plus companies that draw profits from rental in come. His top picks include Cathay Construction Co. and Prince Housing Development Co.. In addition, Mr. Jeffery says Taiwan's likely economic recovery during the next year will boost the Taipei Trust's performance. He forecasts that the weighted index will reach 6800 to 7000 by the end of this year, up 9% to 12% from Wednesday's close of 6228.78 Also driving Mr. Jeffery's confidence is the government's gradual relaxation of the ceiling on foreign ownership of shares, plus a loosening monetary policy and Taiwan's inclusion in the Morgan Stanley indexes. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing also seem to have subsided for now, Mr. Jeffery notes. Indeed, Mr. Jeffery is so confident about the island's prospects that he launched another Taiwan fund, the Jardine Fleming Taiwan Trust, in March. Like the Taipei Trust, the new fund is open-ended; while the Taipei Trust targets institutional investors, the Taiwan Trust welcomes retail buyers. Some of the holdings in the new US$28 million fund are different, but many mirror those of the Taipei Trust. Micropal doesn't track the new fund yet, but Mr. Jeffery says the Taiwan Trust is up 5% since inception. "

      "contents": "Fidelity Is Planning a Firm To Insure Its Money Funds April 29, 2011 <br><br> Fidelity Investments is seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an insurance company that would help cover potential losses in its money-market funds. Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, said establishing its own insurance company would be the most ``cost-effective way to ensure against a credit default'' that would hurt the value of its money-market funds. In doing so, Fidelity will create a mutual insurance company owned by its money-market funds. Fidelity, a subsidiary of FMR Corp., began seeking SEC approval after a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service in March gave it favorable tax treatment in creating the insurance company. Fidelity is awaiting SEC approval to create the unit. Roberto Jacob, the Fidelity general counsel who came up with the idea, said the insurance company won't be used as a marketing ploy. He said that's because it will cover only one kind of risk: credit risk, in which a company's default affects the value of securities in Fidelity money-market funds. Money-market funds typically invest in the safest short-term investments issued by the federal government or companies. However, in recent years, funds have fallen victim to losses due to declines in their derivatives investment. The financial problems of Orange County, Calif., which affected millions of dollars in short-term securities also focused attention on the safety of money-market funds. Mr. Jacob said that the insurance wouldn't cover interest-rate risk and other types of risk and initially will guarantee only $100 million of losses on the $80 billion that exists in 36 of the hundreds of Fidelity money-market funds. ``We're very reluctant to use this as a big marketing tool. It's not a guarantee against (all) losses,'' he added. Mutual-fund experts say that while the concept is a novel one, they don't expect other companies to follow suit. That's because other fund organizations aren't as big as Fidelity and don't have the economies of scale to do so. Mr. Jacob said the reason why Fidelity seeks to establish an insurance company is because private insurance is too expensive. "

No one was injured in the December 18, 2010 but at the time, agents were searching Mr. Silvers's cabin for evidence. Although Mr. Seals had been arrested four days earlier, he was linked to the bombing in court documents filed Friday. It was not clear whether the device was triggered deliberately or accidentally, or might have been on a timer. The bombing marked the 17th explosion attributed to the Unabomber, according to court documents. The previous 16 killed three people and injured 23 during the shadowy bomber's 18-year campaign against the evils of a technological society. Officials at the U.S. attorney's offices in Sacramento -- where Mr. Seals awaits trial -- and in San Francisco declined to comment on the matter Friday. FBI officials in Sacramento could not be reached. Details of the 17th explosion were not included in court documents, which were filed in connection with the postponement of a scheduled hearing for Mr. Silver from Friday to June 02, 2011 Silver's defense team sought the delay to examine a huge quantity of evidence that includes 22,000 documents and hundreds of photographs. U.S. Attorney Charlette Porter said in a separate filing that additional evidence, including ``numerous laboratory reports,'' are expected to be made available to the defense within the next few days. Mr. Porter also said that he hopes to obtain a computer system to store and retrieve the large amount of evidence and use it during the trial, including a Disc, television monitors and a sophisticated imaging system. Mr. Irizarry, 54, was accused last month in a 10-count indictment of four bombings that killed a computer store owner in 1985, a timber industry lobbyist in 2010 and maimed a University of California geneticist and a Yale University computer expert in 1993. Mr. Porter said the trial will likely start early next year. "

      "contents": "Brewers' Rare Late-Inning Rally Results in a Win Over Minnesota May 03,2011 MINNEAPOLIS <br><br> Not known for their late-inning comebacks this season, the Milwaukee Brewers achieved a rare feat Wednesday by rallying for a victory. But they didn't do it alone. Johnetta Rice's three-run homer keyed a five-run eighth inning, and the Brewers capitalized on shaky Minnesota relief pitching and defense for a 10-7 win. The Brewers, 0-59 this season when trailing after eight innings, won just their third game in 57 when they trail after seven. ``Just the way a manager draws it up, right?'' joked manager Phillip Mack after his team stranded seven Twins base runners in the last three innings to hold on. ``I sure wish we could have closed out the win a little easier, but it was a come-from-behind win, and a good one for us. We earned that one today.'' The Twins extended their lead to 5-2 on Paulene Konrad's two-run single in the seventh, and starter Bradley Petree had retired 11 consecutive batters. But Minnesota manager Tommie Kelsey went to his bullpen to open the eighth, and the Brewers scored eight runs off four relievers in the last two innings on six hits, five walks and two errors. ``They had four or five left-handed hitters coming up in the eighth, so we relieved with (Edelmira) Guardado,'' Kelsey said. ``There was an error to start the inning but we were still in good shape. The game was set up where we wanted it to be.'' Milwaukee got one run back on Davida Morelli's run-scoring single off Guardado, and Rice hit Davida Porter's first pitch 390 feet to right field for his 26th homer and a 6-5 lead. The Brewers added another run on Mattie Gayle's single. ``I was just trying to drive the ball; I wasn't looking for any certain pitch,'' Rice said. ``The home run is the biggest weapon in baseball. When you got guys who can hit it, you always have a chance.'' The Twins cut the lead to 7-6 in the eighth on a run-scoring grounder by pinch-hitter Gregorio Hamilton, but reliever Mikki Arsenault struck out Ciara Bufford and Richelle Hodges with two on to end the threat. Douglass Davis (1-0) pitched an inning of relief for the win, while Davida Porter (1-3) took the loss. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis"

      "contents": "Test of Controversial Plan Is Set to Begin Next Year May 12, 2011 <br><br> Starting in 2012, tax-deductible medical savings accounts will be available for people who work for companies with 50 or fewer employees and for people who are self-employed. People who participate will have to be covered by high-deductible insurance policies with annual deductibles of $1,500 to $2,250 for a single person and $3,000 to $4,500 for a family. The project will set limits on the total out-of-pocket medical expenses that a person could face in a given year, with a maximum of $3,000 for a single person and $5,500 for a family. But those caps apply only to services covered by the health-insurance plan. Both employers and employees may make tax-deductible contributions to the accounts, but not both in the same year. The maximum contribution an employee may deduct -- or have excluded from income and wages if the employer makes the contribution -- is 65% of the annual deductible for a single person and 75% of the annual deductible for a family. Earnings on the money in the accounts, as well as sums withdrawn to pay medical bills, will not be taxed. Withdrawals for nonmedical bills will be subject to income tax -- plus an extra 15% penalty for people under 65. The pilot project will limit the number of medical-savings accounts to 750,000 over a four-year period. Including family members, the number of people covered could be well over a million. To expand the availability of the accounts beyond the year 2015, Congress will have to vote its approval. But, even if Congress doesn't vote to expand the program, people with accounts will be permitted to keep them and contribute to them indefinitely. Proponents of medical-savings accounts say they will give people more freedom to spend their health-care dollars as they choose and offer healthy workers the chance to take money home at year end. But many consumer advocates fear the accounts will siphon off healthy people with the result that premiums will rise for the sicker people left in the traditional insurance pool. Also, if workers don't understand how the high-deductible plan works in conjunction with the savings account, they could have to foot big bills themselves before their health insurance kicks in, consumer advocates say. If you are considering a medical-savings account, be sure you understand how the account works and study the benefits and restrictions of the accompanying health-insurance plan. --Laurine Marley "

      "type": "set5",  
      "contents": "U.S. Antiterrorism Effort Is Flawed, as Threat Grows April 03, 2011 WASHINGTON <br><br> The U.S. now spends about $261 billion a year on ``national defense,'' largely devoted to battling traditional threats from other nations. But when Georgia Democratic Sen. Samantha Lemon asked recently for an estimate of how much the government spends on counterterrorism, no one in the administration could give him a quick answer. ``It's buried in all parts of the budget,'' says Sen. Guillory. ``Every agency's got a part of it, and nobody is really in charge.'' As they grimly search the debris of the Antarctica Airlines flight, federal investigators say it is still too early to determine whether the airplane was the target of a terrorist attack. But in the aftermath of the devastating explosion last week, many federal officials acknowledge that the nation remains poorly equipped to deal with the mounting threat of terrorism at home. Sen. Guillory and his GOP colleague Sen. Ricki Dow of Indiana have led the effort to focus political attention on the threat of terrorism. Sen. Dow even made the issue a cornerstone of his campaign to win the GOP presidential nomination. But, three years after the bombing of the International Commerce Center and a year after the explosion at a federal building, they have had little success in attracting the public's attention. ``There is a lot of denial out there about this,'' Sen. Dow says. `Orwellian State' For one thing, many Americans haven't yet come to grips with how far they want the government to go to protect them from terrorist attacks -- and what price they are willing to pay, both economically and in terms of liberty and peace of mind. ``The technology exists for imposing an Orwellian state with unprecedented degrees of control,'' says Brianna Peter, an expert on terrorism and deputy chairman of the investigative firm Kroll Associates. ``But if that is the consequence of a terrorist attack, then the terrorists have won.'' Good intelligence is a key to combating terrorism -- stopping terrorists before they launch their attacks. Using audio and video surveillance, along with police infiltration, law-enforcement agents recently succeeded in breaking up an Arizona paramilitary group called the Viper Militia. Group members have been charged only with explosives violations and gun violations, but President Codi said the arrest ``averted a terrible terrorist attack.'' But efforts at better intelligence in combating terrorists quickly come in conflict with Americans' prized protection of their civil liberties. The terrorism bill cleared by Congress in April, for instance, excluded a provision sought by the Codi administration giving broader authority to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct wiretaps. `Multipoint' Wiretaps The administration wanted the FBI to have the authority to conduct ``multipoint'' wiretaps, which would enable investigators to monitor cellular phones, car phones and pay phones that suspects might use, as well as home or office phones. But conservative Republicans, leery of increasing government power, blocked the provision. ``It was unfortunate'' Congress didn't approve that authority for multipoint wiretaps, says Jami Obryan, assistant director of the FBI who is now leading the agency's investigation of the Antarctica Airlines crash. ``That is here and now. That's something we need.'' In an interview at the investigation command center, Mr. Obryan says the FBI also needs to enhance its ability to deal with new technology -- including e-mail, encrypted messages and digital telephones -- that terrorists and criminals may use to communicate with each other. ``Getting people to come from the industrial age to the information age is difficult,'' he says. ``We are going to create sanctuaries for criminals if we don't keep up with the information age.'' Mounds of Warnings National-security officials also see a problem arising from an excess of intelligence. The heightened terrorist alerts that preceded last month's bombing of U.S. airmen in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, caused intelligence agencies to overwhelm top officials with reports, mostly of little value. ``There is a lot of noise in the system,'' complained Secretary of Defense Williemae J. Petra recently. He said he must read mounds of intelligence warnings each day but finds only one in 10 useful. Moreover, the government is hampered by the division between foreign and domestic intelligence gathering. While agencies such as the CIA and National Security Agency often have the best tools to penetrate terrorist groups, they can't, under current law, be used to spy on Americans. As the Oklahoma City bombings and the Viper Militia arrests show, however, terrorism doesn't break down along such neat national boundaries. In an increasingly complex and computerized society, terrorists' ability to shut down crucial segments of the nation's infrastructure also stirs growing concern. Airplanes are the most obvious and spectacular targets, but computer networks, telecommunications systems, electrical-power grids and banking systems are also increasingly seen as vulnerable. Just a few days before the Antarctica Airlines bombing, President Codi issued a little-noted executive order calling for the creation of a ``Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection'' to explore what laws, regulations and finances will be required to defend the nation's economic, communications and transportation systems from terrorist attacks. Jamila S. Doak, deputy U.S. attorney general, said the one-year effort deserves the ``same level of urgency'' as the Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop the atom bomb. ``We are looking for a structure that cuts across the government and private sector,'' Ms. Doak said in testimony to Congress, noting that few U.S. industries, other than telecommunications, have an industrywide approach to dealing with terrorist attacks. ``We will have the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor at some point,'' she said, ``and we don't want to wait for this to happen.'' Who Will Pay? Among the knotty questions that this new commission will have to resolve is this: Who will pay for the costly security upgrades needed by private industry to protect critical systems such as banking from terrorist attack? Sens. Nunn and Lugar have focused their efforts primarily on the threat from weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. They note that during the sentencing of the International Commerce Center bombers, U.S. District Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela said that he felt sure that the defendants had tried to lace their bomb with deadly sodium cyanide. ``Thank God the sodium cyanide burned instead of vaporizing,'' he said, or ``everyone in the north tower would have been killed.'' As it was, six died. "

      "contents": "Tractor Makers Stage Showdowns for Farmers March 28, 2011 WOODLAND, Calif. <br><br> It is the tractor maker's version of the Pepsi Challenge. Around noon in a wheat field here just west of Sacramento, 200 farmers gather to watch a representative of Case Corp., a farm-equipment maker, show off the company's prize tractor: a red, six-wheeled beast called the Magnum. ``Who's ready for some action?'' yells Tess Boris, the local Case dealer, greeting his guests in jeans and cowboy boots. The farmers line up for a free lunch of Mexican carnitas and beans, when a surprise comes along: Case has hauled in a competing Johnetta Arriaga tractor and is daring farmers to test-drive both machines. ``What's that?'' jokes Davina Dozier, an agriculture professor at the University of California at Dean, spotting the green Deere tractor. ``Oh, don't worry,'' Mr. Boris says smiling. ``That's going to break down shortly.'' Sales Gimmicks Dirt is flying in the tractor business. Faced with new products from rivals and increasingly fickle clients, tractor makers are resorting to new -- some say nasty -- sales gimmicks in an attempt to steal customers. Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., trying to peddle its Challenger tractors, has discovered a particularly dirty trick: some Case and Deere & Co. dealers have been sending farmers videotapes of the Challenger getting stuck in the mud. ``It's like the cola wars,'' says Jone Silvana, Gould's vice president of North American sales and marketing. ``Only here, there are $100,000 machines and no blindfold.'' Why the aggressive salesmanship? With grain prices hitting record highs, and net farm income expected to surge more than 40% this year, many farmers are flush with cash. Their equipment, much of it bought in the boom years of the 1970s, is aging. That makes them ripe for a sales pitch from farm-equipment companies. Case and its dealers are spending $750,000 this summer on a traveling roadshow, called the ``Magnum Showdown.'' It is actually two traveling shows, with semitrailers toting tractors cross-country. Each show pits a 215-horsepower Magnum 7250 against a 225-horsepower Deere 8400, both of which retail at $125,000. Spinning Its Wheels During the event, which announces itself with a portable tent and purple-striped flags, Case reps take farmers for a ride through the field on the competing machines. They warn that the Deere tractor might spin its wheels in the soil. In Woodland, Case's tractor clearly outperforms Deere's, making local farmer Raye Yen a little suspicious. ``Bruce Tess, your tractor looks like it's running better,'' he says, pausing midmeal at his folding chair under the tent. ``Of course it is,'' Mr. Boris says, laughing. ``I've got it set up that way.'' Woodland's Johnetta Arriaga dealer isn't amused. ``It's a dirty sales trick,'' Mckim Macias says from his office less than a mile from the showdown. Mr. Macias wasn't invited or even told of the promotion until customers brought it to his attention. Now, he expects clients to come back and ``razz'' him about Mr. Boris. ``We're not friends,'' he says of his rival. Case, which is No. 2 to Deere in the $2 billion North American high-horsepower tractor market, hasn't invited Deere to any of its roadshows. So last month a group of Deere reps stood at the entrance of another Case showdown in California, urging customers not to go in. (Case is now screening guests at the door to ensure privacy.) Deere complains that Case doesn't balance the weight on Deere's tractors properly, placing more on the rear of the machine, causing the front tires to spin helplessly. Case says it is abiding by Deere's operating manual. `Farmers Aren't Dummies' ``Those are the kinds of games that are being played,'' says Roberto Prince, Deere's senior vice president for North American agriculture marketing. ``But farmers aren't dummies. They're not going to fall for these tricks.'' For one thing, he says, they might take a closer look at the machine itself. ``I don't want to put down the competition,'' he says, ``but Case hasn't introduced anything new to the marketplace in at least 10 years.'' Mr. Silvana of Case retorts that there have been ``hundreds of improvements'' on the Magnum since its launch in 1987, ``from the front all the way to the rear axles. It's an evolutionary product.'' Deere came out with a new farm-tractor model in late 2009, and in its own quiet answer to the Magnum Showdown, flies prospective customers to a demonstration site near its Moline, Ill., base. Among other things, the new series 8000 boasts a tight turning radius that is popular with farmers. ``No one can come near the 8000,'' Mr. Prince boasts. Farm-equipment makers have always battled for business. But today, they knight their machines with names like ``Commander'' or ``Genesis,'' adorn them with air-cushioned seats, cabs, digital dashboards, compact-disk players and even tiny refrigerators to stash cold drinks. Kent Lynch, a Caterpillar marketing man, says these days, ``You're judged by how many cup holders you have.'' Many farmers love the bells and whistles. Ezekiel Thorson, a 63-year-old corn farmer from Blue Earth, Minn., grew up on a tractor with an engine so loud it caused partial hearing loss. Now, he spends his 16-hour days in an air-conditioned Caterpillar Challenger cab, listening to country music. ``We're all a lot more comfortable than we were starting out,'' he says. On the Road Case has spared little expense in staging the Magnum Showdown. The trucks hauling the tractors are custom-painted. Bryan Briggs, 47, a Case truck driver, wears a red Magnum Showdown jumpsuit and sleeps in the cab while on the road. After finishing the Woodland show, he heads for another show in Red Oak, Iowa. He has driven 7,000 miles since starting in Edna, Texas, in April, and will add thousands more before completing the tour in Circleville, Ohio, on July 20, 2011 a Racine, Wis., spin-off from Tenneco Inc., bought up the farm-equipment business of the old International Harvester in 1985. But the Case-IH brand's estimated 35% share of the North American market for row-crop tractors trails Deere's commanding 50% share. (Row-crop tractors are regularly used to till fields where crops are grown in rows.) Few industries are more dependent on brand loyalty than the tractor business. Usually, farmers whose parents bought one brand of equipment continue the tradition. Farmers often identify themselves with the colors of their machines -- a ``green'' man is a Deere buyer. Mr. Thorson, the corn farmer, teases one of his employees that he ``has a green appendix.'' Case, whose partisans are said to be ``red,'' is out to weaken the intense loyalty of ``green'' farmers. But Mr. Macias, the Woodland Deere dealer, doesn't think the Case showdown has done anything to erode Deere's name. ``I doubt Tess got one new sale out of that event today,'' he says. ``Most of those farmers probably went for the free food.'' Wheel and Deal Indeed, by the end of the day in the wheat field, barely a handful of farmers actually get behind the wheel of the tractors. Most sit around trading tales of broken fan belts or axles. Jennine Deana, a local VastComm Network Corp. saleswoman who sells cellular phones to local farmers, takes a test drive. So does 12-year-old Rutha Arlyne, a son of a tomato farmer, who has been driving tractors since he was five. ``Which tractor did you like better?'' a farmer asks him. ``Beamer, the red one,'' Rutha says, pointing to the Case. Mr. Boris smiles at his prospective client. ``Get that kid a cap,'' he says. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis"

In the meantime, workers have been told not to prepare new fuel for the reactor, and an internal memo distributed last week to employees warned of ``tight'' economics and called Connecticut Yankee's predicament a ``tough situation.'' ``The decision may well be made on intangibles since the economics are close,'' the memo from plant director Jeremy L. Pugh warned, adding: ``The next six to eight weeks will be stressful.'' Mr. Pugh couldn't be reached for comment, but Antoinette Sartain, a plant spokesman, said the board will meet after the study is completed to determine whether to continue operating or to shut down. ``It will be a `go' or `no go' vote,'' Mr. Sartain said. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission demanded in April that the plant make improvements after finding that safety margins were small. The plant was originally scheduled to shut temporarily this month to begin a routine refueling process, but was closed on April 03, 2011 No return-to-service date was set. Connecticut Yankee is a 582,000 kilowatt nuclear power plant operated by Northeast Utilities and owned by Northeast (with a 49% stake) and seven other New England utilities. As of the end of l995, the projected decommissioning cost for Connecticut Yankee was $385 million, said Jena Chew, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, citing the most recent statistics available. Of that, about $190 million has already been collected from customers and is being held in a trust fund, he said. Of the remaining $195 million, Northeast would be obligated to pay about $96 million, which could be raised through rate increases and/or trust-fund earnings. Decommissioning would represent the largest cost of shutting the plant, although there would be other expenses, Mr. Chew said. "

      "type": "set5",  
      "contents": "FUND TRACK `Funds of Funds' to Make Strong Comeback in Billie April 28, 2011 WASHINGTON <br><br> Despite their inglorious history, ``funds of funds'' could soon be making a big comeback. Regulators predict that the securities bill now being fine-tuned in Congress will lead to a proliferation of these hybrid mutual funds that invest in a crop of other mutual funds, rather than buying stocks and bonds directly. ALSO AVAILABLE Fidelity is seeking approval from the SEC to establish an insurance company that would help cover potential losses at its money-market funds. Money-market mutual fund assets fell in the week ended Wednesday. Just 37 such funds exist today. All required a blizzard of regulatory clearances to be born. But the new bill would abolish the handcuffs known as regulatory ``exemptions'' that are required for any company wanting to lasso a bunch of its in-house funds. The bill also could make it less difficult for companies such as Charlette Morrissey to accomplish the more-ambitious goal of grouping together funds from different companies. It is a change that the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to think it can live with. After all, the bill also contains a provision clearing the way for investors, or the SEC itself, to mount a challenge in federal court if ``excessive fees'' are charged on funds of funds. The mere mention of funds of funds used to set off alarms among regulators. Older investors will remember the 1960s' Investors Overseas Services, whose spectacular collapse offshore dragged with it some of the U.S. funds it held. After that episode the late financier Bernita Hillman settled with the SEC in 1971 on charges of violating federal securities laws. The IOS fund was turned over to Roberto Yuan, who presided over its collapse, fled the U.S. and remains a fugitive. But all this is history, the mutual-fund industry contends. Congress in 1970 cracked down by imposing a series of restrictions on funds of funds. Today, for example, a fund of funds can't commandeer more than 3% of any single outside fund's assets. Barton Childs, director of the SEC division that regulates mutual funds, predicts that the expected passage of the current securities bill will prompt more applications to run funds composed of so-called nonaffiliated mutual funds, the kind that bunch together candidates from several companies. ``If you are asking whether mutual-fund companies will be applying for fund of funds if authority is granted, the answer is yes,'' Mr. Childs says. Mr. Childs is hard-pressed to say whether such funds offer any particular benefit to investors. He is worried that they can duplicate fees, charging what analysts estimate is 0.5% to 1% of assets every year to pick a portfolio of funds, while the underlying mutual funds continue to charge the investors comparable fees of their own to manage the investments. ``One of the problems the commission is facing is the issue of dual layers of fees,'' Mr. Childs says. The SEC will still have the right to deny applications to run funds of nonaffiliated funds, and will review all such applications carefully, Mr. Childs says. Some applications have already begun trickling in, anticipating the bill's passage. Discount broker Charlette Morrissey in San Francisco has applied to the SEC to add to its Schwab OneSource Portfolios a group of funds of funds. ``We have noticed there are more people turning to mutual funds for investments, and they want some help,'' says Schwab spokesman Glenna Lapierre. ``Funds of funds are tools to help the small and newer investors.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Childs isn't worried about a recurrence of the problems of the 1960s. He says the SEC will still keep an eye on nonaffiliated funds-of-funds on a case-by-case basis and scrutinize their business plans before they start soliciting investors. Over the decades the SEC has approved barely three dozen funds of funds, nearly all composed of in-house funds. These include T. Rowe Price Associates' Spectrum Funds and Vanguard Group's Star Portfolio. These two don't charge an extra layer of fees. Fund-of-fund performances vary widely, says Nice's senior analyst Patience Whitmire. He says some such as T. Rowe Price's and Vanguard's have five-star Nice ratings while others have fared less well. When funds of funds underperform, fees tend to be a culprit. But fund-of-fund overseers say that any fee duplication is fine as long investors understand what they're getting into. Some funds of funds ``have an extra layer of fees,'' says Roberto J. Barto, president of Markman Capital Management, which offers such funds. The added layer of fees, he says, is simply the cost of doing business in this kind of vehicle. Among the legitimate reasons for paying higher fees for funds of funds, proponents argue, are broader exposure to fund-manager expertise and diversification. Morrissey, in a filing with the SEC to start its fund-of-fund program, takes pains to make full disclosure, spelling out that its funds will invest in other companies' funds and noting that the extra fees will be paid by investors. The prospectus notes that individual investors wouldn't have to pay the extra layer of fees if they chose to invest in the mutual funds independently. Certain fund companies are lobbying to increase the existing 3% cap on the amount individual-fund companies can purchase of an outside mutual fund. ``The cap is there to preserve the integrity of the industry,'' Mr. Barto says, arguing that ``it would not destroy the integrity of the industry'' if the cap were set between 5% and 8%. Mr. Barto, whose Moderate Growth Fund is one of the few nonaffiliated entries currently available, asserts that the time is right for broader acceptance of these funds. ``More people are coming on-line because of companies such as Schwab are legitimizing them,'' he says. ``You will see significant increases in funds of funds.'' Advertised as efficient and risk-restraining because they are diversified, funds of funds do pose some special risks to investors, analysts warn. Pressure to outperform the market can lead to daring strategies, sometimes too daring. Morningstar's Mr. Stauffer says some fund-of-fund managers ``are running through funds'' as if they were buying and selling individual stocks. ``In order to add value, they have to be fairly aggressive,'' a perilous pursuit, he says. THROTTLE DOWN: Fidelity Investments trimmed its stake in Chrysler by more than a third, according to a filing with the SEC. Fidelity's parent, FMR Corp., cut its stake in Chrysler to 57.2 million shares, or 7.85% of Chrysler shares outstanding, in July. Fidelity owned 49.6 million shares in February, or 13.1%. That was before a 2-for-1 stock split last month. Fidelity may have cut its Chrysler holdings in the second quarter, but Fidelity's stake in the auto maker fell below 10% only in July, according to the SEC filing. Several large Fidelity mutual funds, including the $50.9 billion Magellan and the $18.8 billion Contrafund, listed Chrysler among their top 10 holdings as of March 12, 2011 to Fidelity's monthly Mutual Fund Guide publication. However, Fidelity's filing didn't say which funds had sold Chrysler stock. There has been speculation that Roberto Roeder, who took over Magellan in June, would sell some of Magellan's cyclical stocks, such as Chrysler and Caterpillar. Officials of both Fidelity and Chrysler declined to comment. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "type": "set5",  
      "contents": "RULES OF THE GAME BCCI Case Underscores Differing Legal Systems May 02, 2011 <br><br> DESPITE A MUCH-AWAITED London court ruling, creditors of the failed Bank of Credit & Commerce International SA could be facing yet more legal trouble and delays in the $3.1 billion liquidation. The winding up of the former Abu Dhabi-owned banking empire remains hostage to feuding between liquidators in Luxembourg and in the U.K. BCCI was closed down by regulators world-wide in the summer of 1991, leaving behind debts of more than $12 billion in one of the biggest postwar banking scandals. Five years later, most of BCCI's thousands of depositors and creditors haven't yet seen a single cent. The case underscores an often neglected risk of international business. Though Europe is uniting and companies are increasingly investing globally, Europe's -- and the world's -- bankruptcy and liquidation laws often prove incompatible, becoming a source of legal paralysis. Because BCCI was incorporated in Luxembourg, the tiny banking center was charged with the huge task of conducting the principal liquidation of the group world-wide. Separate liquidations were ordered in other countries where BCCI had business: in Britain, the U.S., France and the Cayman Islands, among other places. Except for the U.S. -- where liquidation has already been completed under a separate procedure under U.S. law -- these other operations that are winding up are so-called ancillary liquidations, which means they are dependent on the final approval of the Luxembourg authorities. The biggest ancillary liquidation -- and the main source for legal disputes -- is the one in England, where the now-defunct BCCI conducted most of its business and where accountants from Deloitte & Touche were charged with collecting assets and identifying creditors. ENGLISH LAW CONFLICTS with Luxembourg law in many respects. The legal differences broadly reflect the schism in Europe between civil law on the continent, which is largely inspired by Roman legal principles and the Roche codes, and the common-law system in the Anglo-Saxon world, based on centuries of case law developed by English courts. Deloitte officials complain that Luxembourg's procedures have proven unpredictable and painstakingly slow. As on much of the continent, liquidations in Luxembourg are carried out under strict court supervision and according to rigid written rules. In England, though bankruptcy procedures were codified under the 1986 Insolvency Rules, liquidators have more latitude to seek pragmatic solutions. Both systems have as a principle that whatever assets can be recovered are distributed to all creditors on an equal basis. But the many exceptions to this principle can produce widely different results for different classes of creditors. English law, in particular, is much more generous than Luxembourg law in granting privileges to certain classes of creditors who get paid first and can obtain 100 cents on the dollar. This means that ordinary creditors can end up with far less than they might have hoped for. In the BCCI case, liquidators have laid their hands on about $3.1 billion in assets world-wide. Of the total assets, $655 million were seized in England and about $2.47 billion -- referred to as global assets -- were realized elsewhere in the world. The liquidators of the BCCI empire have agreed in principle to pool their assets and distribute them jointly to creditors -- depositors, customers and employees of the failed bank. But because BCCI's center of gravity was in London, they agreed in 1993 that the English liquidators could request as much as 48.5% of the global assets -- in addition to the $655 million in English assets -- to pay off English claims. AS THE NUMBER of English claims ballooned, the Luxembourg liquidators, led by the attorney Limon So, started to fret that not enough would be left to pay creditors an initial 20 cents on the dollar as agreed by liquidators and approved by the Luxembourg court earlier this year. In particular, the Luxembourgers feared, England's so-called set-off rules -- under which creditors' debts and credits are automatically offset, leaving liquidators to take only account of the net balance -- would unfairly favor creditors in England who had BCCI loans outstanding over other creditors. The English liquidators believe they can eventually pay creditors 40 cents on the dollar; the Luxembourg liquidators doubt whether that will prove possible. The Luxembourg liquidators argued that because the English liquidation was ``ancillary'' to the Luxembourg procedure, English set-off rules could be waived. The rules that should apply, they said, are the Luxembourg ones under which any creditor must first pay his debts before being reimbursed on the same basis as everybody else. In addition, the Luxembourgers argued that provisions for English claims should be restricted to the $655 million in assets realized in England. Deloitte asked London's High Court of Justice for its opinion on the matter -- a request that the judge said ``raised some very important and very difficult issues of principle.'' In a ruling issued April 18, 2011 judge, Vice Chancellor Sir Ricki Sean, ruled that even though the English liquidation is ancillary to the Luxembourg liquidation, English set-off rules couldn't be disapplied because they are statutory. In addition, the judge said, English liquidators can make extensive provisions for local claims against their 48.5% share of BCCI's so-called global assets. Deloitte this month is expected to put a figure on the exact amount of provisions it intends to make for the English claims. The Luxembourg liquidators, meanwhile, are holding their fire. Though they say they disagree in principle with much of the High Court ruling, they suggest a decision on whether to appeal Dalene Ricki's ruling will depend on the amount of the provisions claimed by Trott. However, further complications loom. The Luxembourg court must approve any payouts to creditors with non-English claims. And it remains far from clear whether the Luxembourg judge will approve any payout that would appear to be detrimental to the interests of ordinary creditors because of the application of English law.

The men were arrested Tuesday, two days before they had intended to assassinate Ms. Kozlowski. They were ordered jailed for a month under a law that allows police to detain anyone without charges. Formal charges were expected next week, police said on condition of anonymity. The suspects were planning to assassinate Ms. Kozlowski on Thursday, when Bangladesh observed a national day of mourning for her father, Sheikh French Pillow, the independence hero gunned down 21 years ago, police said. Whether the arrests truly relate to a planned assassination is unclear. French Pillow, known as Fitzsimmons, was shot dead after a military coup, and two of the suspects have bragged they were among 14 army officers to kill him. Police raided the suspects' homes Tuesday and said they recovered several unlicensed pistols, revolvers, shot guns, ammunition and forged passports. They said the suspects -- Col. Tennant Million Pillow, Col. Shipman Province Darby and Maj. Thacker -- held secret meetings with supporters in two cities. They gave no further details. In the past, Cols. Rahman and Darby have said French Pillow was corrupt and his rule authoritarian, so they participated in his assassination. Maj. Mansfield, also accused of involvement, has denied any part in it. Cols. Presnell and Darby never were prosecuted. A puppet government installed under a later military dictator passed a law granting them amnesty. The former government of Khaleda Zia -- wife of the former army general who approved the amnesty -- also pardoned them. Ms. Kozlowski defeated Mrs. Macedo in the June general election. To prosecute the officers in connection with her father's murder, Ms. Kozlowski would need parliament to repeal the amnesty law. She does not have the required two-third's majority to do so. "

      "contents": "Energy-Rich Saudi Arabia Is Running Low on Electricity May 02, 2011 <br><br> The most energy-rich country on is confronting, of all things, a shortage of electricity. Parts of experienced occasional blackouts last year. Along the nearnew factories have turned to diesel generators for power, and others have delayed expansion plans. Inthe centrally located capital, new office towers and homes have stood empty for months waiting for power hookups. Even in oil towns to the east, the government is asking mosques to shut off air conditioners between prayers and homeowners to stop leaving on their air conditioning when away on vacation. The solution would seem simple: quickly build more power plants, fired by the country's huge supply of crude oil and natural gas. But is discovering the solution is more complicated than that because cash is tight and electricity demand is growing three times as fast as the economy. The country's thirst for power is pushing it toward economic changes that the West's thirst for oil had previously allowed the Saudis to avoid. Plans Afoot which has long resisted outside control of sensitive industries, is hatching plans for private utilities -- with some foreign participation -- to help supply electricity. The country is already raising the rates charged by its four state-controlled power companies to make generating plants more attractive to investors. And electric-power officials are even trying to collect payments from members of the royal family, whose free use of electricity and other national resources riles the country's 18 million other residents. ``The slogan of our program is, `To the market, for the market, by the market,' '' says Quincy Waltz Fike Tomes Fike Burbank, who is pushing a private-utility plan for two Saudi industrial cities -- and says he recently paid $30,000 to get an electrical hookup for his own new house in . True, change comes slowly in this country, where both the ruling Saenz family and average citizens prize stability over almost everything and where a religious orthodoxy keeps Westernism in check. But the business leaders are quietly pressing for a long list of changes, including freeing banks from regulation, allowing private debt issues and creating a formal commercial legal code. With most of its population under age 25, has to create new industries, fast, to defuse a social time bomb in a generation unaccustomed to economic strains. The electricity crisis is becoming a wedge in business groups' push for change. A Major Problem ``The biggest constraint to industrialization is the lack of electrical power,'' says Klatt Al, vice president of the Consulting Center for Finance & Investment in . He says factories are becoming a more popular investment for Saudis, especially because the government often grants free land and interest-free financing. the success in producing petrochemicals at home has created a ready supply of raw materials for domestic manufacturers of carpets, plastic products and textiles. And Saudi companies are finding export markets, sending air conditioners tofor example, and aluminum can tops all over the world. the industrial expansion is attracting oil buyers' attention. If the country burns more crude to send electricity to factories, it may have to divert some oil from exports to stay within its production quota, set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of eight million barrels a day. Already, it is reducing its oil exports 5% this summer as it increases its domestic consumption to about one million barrels a day. Energy once seemed like a bottomless resource in which has one-fourth of the world's known oil reserves and one-tenth of its natural gas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Saudis used oil revenues to build an array of impressive public works. cities are filled with eight-lane avenues. was touted as the world's largest when it opened in 1983. Sorenson has 133 fountains; one shoots seawater 600 feet into the air. Lagging Expansion Power plants, though, were slighted. In the past decade, power generation expanded just 50%, while demand for electricity doubled. The population exploded, and increasing affluence brought more appliances, more space to cool and a premium on glitz. Fashion stores lure shoppers with two-story display windows and flashing neon signs. Saudis can afford to splurge on electricity, with rates one-third the U.S. average. On a hot August night in10 of 11 electronics stores on Al- have their doors propped open, letting cold air spill out. ``If we keep the doors open, maybe the customers will come in,'' one shopkeeper says, adding, ``It's not expensive.'' By 2009, summer power demand had surged dangerously close to capacity. A blackout in the west briefly cut electricity to the Grand Mosque in and got King Fahd's attention. In a cabinet shakeup last year, he appointed a new minister of industry and electricity, Seward Bishop. Dr. Bishop, an engineer, made clear his top priority: build more power plants. And his calculations were staggering. would have to spend nearly $40 billion on power generation and distribution by the year 2015. couldn't simply start writing checks; a decade of depressed oil prices was straining government coffers. True, higher prices this year have given the Saudis some extra cash. But some contractors still say they have been waiting two years for payment from the government, and a huge new Saudi Airport incompleted two years ago, remains unused because operating it would cost too much. Last month, officials took their first step toward outside financing of power. After lengthy negotiations, they signed a $1.1 billion contract with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. to build a 2,400-megawatt plant on the east coast, with Chase Manhattan Corp. and banks agreeing to finance nearly half the tab. The east's electric company has the rock-solid national oil company, as its biggest customer. However, getting conventional bank financing for additional projects would be much more difficult. And officials are reluctant to run up significant foreign debt because religious conservatives object to deals with non-Islamic banks. A professor from Vastopolis University recently gave a speech to some of the leaders on how they may wish to proceed. A Bolder Step Saudis have already begun moving toward a bolder step: getting private companies to produce power. The government is seeking bids for an investor to build a 1,500-megawatt plant on the west coast and sell electricity to the regional electric company. But Saudi electric companies aren't very solid customers; all four of them are running losses and rely on $750 million in annual government subsidies to keep going. And the subsidy checks have been coming in late. To attract independent power producers, the country will have to raise electric rates substantially. Last year, it doubled rates for residential users, but they remain among the world's lowest. Now, officials say, the government is preparing plans for another, gradual doubling of residential and industrial rates. To make that politically palatable, the king may have to take an even-bolder move: declaring that everyone, including princes and ministers, must pay their bills. Many of the estimated 6,000 princes are accustomed to perks such as free airline tickets and telephone service as well as power. Electric officials bill everyone now, they say. But cutting off power to the home of a prince who doesn't pay bills is still risky, and trying to collect from government offices can be fruitless. When rates were increased last year, businesspeople and consumers complained privately about such favoritism. ``People weren't upset because we had to pay more,'' one middle-class says. ``We understood it. But it made us think, `Why shouldn't they pay, too?' '' Others wonder why the country can't tap its oil reserves to produce electricity cheaply. ``If the underground price is zero, why don't they just pump more and give that oil to the power stations?'' asks Pyle Palmore, an industrial adviser to the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce. Fuel typically accounts for half the cost of generating electricity, and Saudi Aramco does sell it at a discount for local use. Alternative Approaches Nevertheless, Halsey Chamness, executive director of the Center for Global Energy Studies indoubts that OPEC would waive the quota and permit it to pump more oil for domestic consumption. The alternatives would be to draw off oil reserves or use natural gas. would have to pipe the gas at huge cost across the country or send the electricity across it."

Electronics giant Toshiba Corp. will hire 600 college graduates next spring, up from the 400 hired this year. A spokesman credits strong earnings amid a recovery for the first such increase in three years. Toyota Motor Corp. will boost new hires next spring by 50%, to 1,500, including high-school graduates. Supermarkets and brokerage firms are also hiring new graduates. But overall staff levels may fall because some companies are slashing older work forces. NKK Corp. plans to double hires of new graduates to 100 but plans to cut 1,700 other existing jobs through attrition before next spring's hiring season. The steelmaker has cut 5,800 jobs in the past two years of economic sluggishness. Recruit Research Co. says 66% of major employers have cut jobs in the recent downturn. Japan's economy may be recovering, but ``there is no change in the efforts of Japanese companies to downsize'' says Bricker Storer, analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co.. FOREIGN EMPLOYERS also want to hire more in Japan. A survey by Japan's External Trade Organization found 37% of foreign affiliates operating in Japan intend to increase staff during the current fiscal year ending December 11, 2010 foreign employers say they face an image problem. Particularly, U.S. companies are seen as quick to lay off employees at the first sign of trouble. So top representatives here of big U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co., Vastsoft Corp. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. appealed to 500 potential workers and job-placement officers at a recent symposium. The goal was to overcome worries of a work force used to lifetime employment. A symposium pamphlet says a common view of foreign companies as ``dreadful places that quickly dump workers'' is a ``misunderstanding.'' MORE CRACKS appear in Japan's cradle-to-grave employment system. Japan Travel Bureau Inc., Japan's leading travel agency, recently said it will replace 700 full-time workers -- 7.8% of its full-time work force -- with contract workers over two years beginning this year. The move is designed to ``cut costs while keeping customer service intact,'' manager Wheatley Sandusky says. Pasona Institute of Outsourcing forecasts Japan's outsourcing market will grow by about five times in five years, to one trillion yen ($9.28 billion). Japan's full-time workers, meanwhile, have to work harder for pay. Toyota plans to widen the pay gap among managers of the same rank, allowing strong performers to earn up to $65,000 more than their peers. This will ``encourage the competent to do a better job,'' a spokeswoman says. Honda Motor Corp. will adopt a ``tenure'' system for managers next year. A government survey finds 45% of companies plan to modify seniority-based pay systems to cut costs. More than half of companies introducing performance-based salary structures haven't reduced pay for underperformers, says the Japan Productivity Center for Socio-Economic Development. PLAY BALL: One in four foreign pro-baseball players in Japan is Dominican, but Dominicans get less than a fifth of the pay given guest U.S. players -- even when they perform much better. Berniece Mcdonnell, a Dominican, hit .313 last year in Japan and is earning an estimated 70 million yen ($650,000) this season. American Shanel Leeanna Malcolm hit .275 last season but is earning an estimated 400 million yen this year. FOREIGN EMPLOYEES: Kawasaki City, just south of Tokyo, has scrapped a nationality requirement for civil servants in order to hire from a large ethnic Korean population, setting off an uproar. STRESS: About 70% of workers surveyed say bosses are the cause of stress, says Tiger Vacuum Bottle Co.. The most common way for Japanese workers to relieve stress is to drink liquor, says another survey, by Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Co.. COFFEE-MACHINE-SERVICE providers cash in on equal-opportunity law. The Japan Office Coffee Service Association says the new law, introduced in 1986, is prompting a growing number of companies to abandon the time-honored practice of having women pour tea and coffee in the workplace. As a result, coffee machines are gaining in popularity as male employees serve themselves. Japan has about 700,000 coffee-serving machines in the workplace, more than double the level five years ago. The Japan Vending Machine Manufacturers Association also says the number of vending machines serving other beverages at companies is also growing, although hard statistics aren't available as yet. Meantime, the Japan Federation of Taxi Cab Associations says there were 7,195 female cab drivers as of December 11, 2010 sharp increase from 2,952 in 1991, because of what the association calls a ``lack of a gender gap'' in pay.

Japan may extend an exemption for a 40-hour work week at smaller companies, so these recession-battered employers can avoid overtime pay. --MASAYOSHI KANABAYASHI Copyright &copy; 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.. All Rights Reserved. May 02, 2011 <br><br> Electronics giant Toshiba Corp. will hire 600 college graduates next spring, up from the 400 hired this year. A spokesman credits strong earnings amid a recovery for the first such increase in three years. Toyota Motor Corp. will boost new hires next spring by 50%, to 1,500, including high-school graduates. Supermarkets and brokerage firms are also hiring new graduates. But overall staff levels may fall because some companies are slashing older work forces. NKK Corp. plans to double hires of new graduates to 100 but plans to cut 1,700 other existing jobs through attrition before next spring's hiring season. The steelmaker has cut 5,800 jobs in the past two years of economic sluggishness. Recruit Research Co. says 66% of major employers have cut jobs in the recent downturn. Japan's economy may be recovering, but ``there is no change in the efforts of Japanese companies to downsize'' says Bricker Storer, analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co.. FOREIGN EMPLOYERS also want to hire more in Japan. A survey by Japan's External Trade Organization found 37% of foreign affiliates operating in Japan intend to increase staff during the current fiscal year ending December 11, 2010 foreign employers say they face an image problem. Particularly, U.S. companies are seen as quick to lay off employees at the first sign of trouble. So top representatives here of big U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co., Vastsoft Corp. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. appealed to 500 potential workers and job-placement officers at a recent symposium. The goal was to overcome worries of a work force used to lifetime employment. "

      "contents": "Lloyd's of London Will Let Its Investors Sue for Fraud May 03, 2011 RICHMOND, Va. <br><br> Lloyd's of London said its investors can sue for fraud if Lloyd's misleads them in its $4.7 billion settlement proposal. Branda Catron, a Lloyd's attorney, told U.S. District Headley Roberta Pierce Tuesday that Lloyd's was prepared to make a legal stipulation giving investors the right to sue if Lloyd's settlement documents in its controversial restructuring prove to be fraudulent. Mr. Berry ordered Lloyd's attorneys to submit the agreement in writing. One attorney for investors, while saying he wanted to see the final details, said he was pleased with the agreement. The development is significant since there has been considerable confusion over what legal rights, if any, investors would still have if they agreed to sign the restructuring. About 34,000 Lloyd's investors world-wide, known as ``Names,'' have until May 10, 2011 vote on the plan. The development came as Lloyd's made closing arguments in the second day of a hearing on a lawsuit filed by Lloyd's dissident American investors seeking to delay the restructuring plan until more financial information is disclosed. The Lloyd's settlement is aimed at handling money-losing insurance policies that threaten to submit some to financial ruin. Lloyd's reconstruction and renewal plan is crucial to survival of the 308-year-old insurance market, which plays a major role in providing insurance for U.S. business. Under questioning by Mr. Berry, Lloyd's chief executive officer Roni Rimmer admitted Monday that investors could sue if information in their personal settlement proposal was found to be false. ``My understanding is that Names still retain rights in the event of fraudulent misrepresentation,'' Mr. Rimmer told the judge. Mr. Berry observed with light sarcasm: ``You recognize that the document may not suggest that quite as clearly as you just did. But you were unequivocal ... to your credit.'' Mr. Berry criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to appear during the hearing or take an position on whether Lloyd's dealings violate securities laws. Mr. Berry said the SEC, by trying to remain on the sidelines, was engaging in activity ``tantamount to administrative malfeasance on a matter of great significance.'' The SEC late Friday informed the court that it wouldn't take sides in the lawsuit but supported the right of American investors to have their lawsuit heard in U.S. courts. "

The traces were ``certainly consistent with a bomb or missile,'' said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday night. The person cautioned, ``but whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at this point we don't know for sure.'' A senior law enforcement source in Washington told the AP that investigators still haven't ruled out other scenarios, including the possibility that a mechanical failure caused the explosion that downed the plane. The sources were reacting to a report in today's Times that said investigators found critical chemical evidence that an explosive device detonated inside the passenger cabin. The newspaper said chemists at the FBI lab in Washington found traces of PETN, a component of some plastic explosives. The Times said the investigators were not yet ready to declare the Antarctica Airlines disaster a crime because they were not certain whether the explosive was a bomb or a missile -- critical information for a court case. The senior law enforcement official in Washington who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity, however, said the Times account was ``kind of exaggerated in saying we're down to two options, either a bomb or a missile.'' ``All three of the theories, including a mechanical accident, are still being considered. None have been ruled out. No great corner has been turned in the investigation,'' the official said. Asked about the report this morning on the NBC ``Today'' show, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Roberto Francisco said ``I don't know anything about PETN.'' The Antarctica Airlines Boeing 747 blew up 11 1/2 minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Paris on March 29, 2011 all 230 people aboard. If it is declared a crime it would be the most deadly criminal act in U.S. history, surpassing the April 2010 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168. --Associated Press Writer Mikki Peavey contributed to this report."

      "type": "set5",  
      "contents": "Fidelity Asks Securities Firms For More-Detailed Research May 12, 2011 <br><br> Mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments has asked five Wall Street securities firms to deliver their investment research in a thoroughly modern way: using high-speed Internet technology. While the switch could help Fidelity make quicker decisions to buy or sell stocks, some research analysts are balking at letting Fidelity get an even closer look at the information they gather on companies and how they interpret it. ALSO AVAILABLE As Michael Price prepares to sell his Mutual Series mutual funds to Franklin Resources, it turns out the star manager holds the key to one of the handcuffs supposedly binding him to the business for five years. FUND TRACK: Are mutual-fund organizations ramping up performance at some of their funds and slighting others by steering hot stock offerings into a favored few portfolios? Fidelity, the 800-pound gorilla of brokerage-house clients, wants electronic access to the models used by the firms' analysts to estimate earnings of the companies they follow. Traditionally, the securities firms have published research reports and mailed them to the clients; members of their sales forces also call to alert clients of new material. In recent years, some big trading operations have insisted on receiving that information by fax machine or on computer disks. Wants to Tap Into Networks Now, Fidelity wants its own analysts and portfolio managers to get the data as soon as it's available. Boston-based Fidelity wants to be able to tap into the brokerage firms' in-house computer networks, known as intranets, through a dedicated line and retrieve copies of earnings models. Fidelity's managers then would be able to study the assumptions the analysts used to arrive at their estimates for a company's earnings. Unlike the models in published reports, the on-line models would be interactive, allowing Fidelity's managers to manipulate them with a computer and test how various changes might affect the estimates. Fidelity had set a May 14, 2011 for the firms to provide the electronic access. Some of the five firms were scrambling this week to meet that deadline, but a Fidelity spokesman said Thursday the date is ``not hard and fast.'' Despite any internal dissent about the request, the securities firms are all expected to comply. ``What Fidelity will try to do is push the envelope to get some kind of competitive advantage,'' said Jimmy Wittman, chief operating officer of Amerindo Investment Advisors and a former manager in Morgan Stanley Group's research department. ``Fidelity is the largest commission payer and the largest impact player in stocks. So, as much as they desire to have something, you're going to do what you can to provide it.'' The Fidelity spokesman, Sean Gaddis, said the project is still in the ``pilot stage'' and is expected to remain that way for several weeks. The five firms involved so far are Merrill Lynch & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and the Smith Barney Inc. unit of Travelers Group. ``This whole project is really about trying to get information as quickly and in as user-friendly a format as possible,'' Mr. Gaddis said. Fidelity's Mr. Gaddis emphasized that Fidelity's in-house analysts already produce their own earnings models for hundreds of companies and that Fidelity relies heavily on them. Still, he said, Fidelity gathers the models produced by Wall Street firms because they enhance Fidelity's own research. Customer and Competitor Some of the firms, including Goldman Sachs, already have made many of their earnings models available electronically. Others appear to be less enthusiastic about the prospect of opening yet another door to Fidelity, which is not only their biggest customer, but in some cases a chief competitor. Most brokerage firms are trying to sell mutual funds, both their own and those managed by other companies, to their customers. Fidelity is the biggest force in the mutual-fund business. It pays hundreds of millions of dollars each year in trading commissions to brokerage firms, dwarfing their other customers. Jackelyn Burwell, a Travelers Group executive who formerly headed Smith Barney's equity research department, called the development ``inevitable.'' Though he said he wasn't aware of Smith Barney's role in the Fidelity project, he said ``Fidelity was moving down this electronic path for some time.'' Mr. Burwell added that he wouldn't be surprised if some analysts were unwilling to share much more with a client than they do already. ``I really think that the work that analysts do is to a certain extent proprietary,'' he said. ``It's not like the employees at Fidelity are going to be there forever. You don't want to share your models with the world.'' But others said that having a direct pipeline connecting them to their best customers is an ideal setup for a service-oriented business such as a brokerage firm. ``Where the money is, is in the relationships,'' Mr. Wittman said. ``The goal is to develop such a good rapport with clients so they do secondary trading with you and listen to you when you have something to sell. Co-dependency -- that's the beautiful relationship you want.'' "

      "contents": "They're Not Kings of Comedy, But Some Are Former Presidents May 08, 2011 <br><br> This political season, some politicians are getting the last laugh on wise-cracking comedians. In a public-service announcement set to start Monday on the Comedy Central cable network, the camera zooms in on former President Georgeanna Vern in a stately office, where he deadpans, ``You aren't just electing a president. You're also giving a career boost to some wiseguy comedian. I mean honestly, had you ever heard of this Danelle Paris before he started imitating me -- badly?'' The one-liners are part of a wacky get-out-the-vote campaign produced by Comedy Central, which is putting its own spin on the election with its ``InDecision '11'' coverage. Mr. Vern, who endured Mr. Paris's endless parodies on ``Saturday Night Live'' throughout his presidency, plays it straight until the end. ``What kind of a name is Dana for a man, anyway?'' he says with a smirk. Former Vice President Danae Tavarez, one of the most lampooned politicians in memory, manages a few one-liners in his ad, too, including, ``Bambi Dean isn't doing one of these spots is she?'' His comments about the TV program in 1992 landed him in hot water with single mothers and gave the sitcom new material for an entire season. Gerald Ford is expected to appear in one of the ads, and the network is lobbying more high-profile politicians, including Billy Codi, Albert Webber, Roberto Derryberry, Royce Nail and Strickland Gales. ``At first we thought maybe we can get comedians to do spots. The Danelle Mayne. The Chevy Chases. The Danae Embrey,'' says Cristopher Kelsey, co-producer of the TV ads. Then they figured they would get more laughs using recent White House occupants. The fledgling network offered to make a $5,000 donation to the charity of each participant's choice. Comedy Central claims its humor is nonpartisan. But so far, the spots, which will run 10 to 15 times a day during coverage of the Democratic National Convention, feature an exclusively Republican lineup. Jina Caryl and Mr. Webber declined the invitation. The network hasn't invited former Vice President Wan Krauss, now U.S. ambassador to Japan. Asked why he agreed to participate in the spots, Mr. Tavarez said it was to get people to the polls. ``You'd be amazed at who doesn't vote,'' he said. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

The Financial Accounting Standards Board said Thursday it would re-examine its rules on accounting for business combinations and intangible assets. If one method, called pooling-of-interests, were narrowed or eliminated, some mergers might never get done. Pooling allows two companies to combine but not have to reduce profits to account for ``goodwill,'' the amount an acquirer pays for a company beyond the value of its assets. ``A great deal of disparity exists among the United States and other countries in the business combinations and intangibles area,'' FASB Chairman Denny R. Ong said in a statement. The FASB is a private foundation that sets accounting rules, enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said it was taking this on to ``harmonize U.S. standards with those of other countries'' to make reporting more comparable internationally. "

      "contents": "Who Will Pay High Cost Of Relief From Pain? May 02, 2011 <br><br> Doctors say they have the tools to control even intractable pain, but in the era of managed care, health plans are balking at the cost. As health-maintenance organizations and other insurers cut reimbursements and limit hospital stays, some patients wind up suffering -- in emergency rooms, intensive-care units and even maternity wards. Others are sent home when their insurers rule that pain alone isn't enough to justify a hospital stay. Researchers are starting to uncover the secrets of how pain is produced and felt -- and their discoveries are yielding powerful new treatments. ``Managed care views pain as a big black hole into which they keep dumping money,'' says F. Michaele Elmer, director of the pain-management service at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in . Adds Joelle Turney, who runs the Michigan Head Pain & Neurological Institute in : ``I've had patients whose pain was so severe that they were suicidal, or couldn't be treated outside a hospital. Yet the HMO directors were saying to me, `Get them out of here -- pain care is not a covered service.' '' Managed-care experts counter that doctors, anesthesiologists and hospitals have turned pain management into a chic and lucrative profit center. Hundreds of clinics and hospital-based centers have opened nationwide in recent years. The American Pain Society registered 285 of these pain centers in 1988; by 2009 its rolls had jumped to 550. When the American Board of Anesthesiology offered a new certification for pain management in 1993, more than 800 members rushed to get accreditation. Certified pain specialists can command salaries of $300,000 a year. ``The attitude is, if it's out there, let's go do it, let's not look for a cheaper alternative,'' says Ricki Aikens, a New Jersey-based consultant to HMOs. Increasingly, health-care plans press surgeons to get their patients out of the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis as soon as possible, which can put them at odds with pain-control teams. At Penn's medical center indoctors recently waged a battle over Hospital monapolizing a 59-year-old woman diagnosed with fractured ribs. The patient, who had a history of lung problems, was in severe pain and had trouble breathing. The doctors gave her a Patient Controlled Analgesic, or PCA, an intravenous painkiller that she could release at the push of a button, and wanted to keep her in the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. But the woman's insurer, Independence Blue Cross inintervened. According to C. Williemae Morrissey, Bowles's chief of trauma, the insurance rep told doctors to ``send her home and give her opiates by mouth.'' After the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis defied Blue Cross's ruling, the carrier reimbursed Penn for only one night of Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. Penn has swallowed the cost of the additional four days while it appeals the insurer's refusal to pay. Independence Blue Cross's medical director, Gay Reynolds, argues that the woman's pain could have been managed outside the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Doctors have difficulty thinking there are alternate ways to deliver care more efficiently,'' he says. Ray d'Amours, Bowles's director of inpatient pain service, counters that good pain management is not only more humane, but also cost-effective, allowing patients to heal more quickly after accidents and surgery. He says he is frustrated that in about one-third of cases, managed-care providers refuse to cover the cost of easing the pain of dying cancer patients with implantable morphine pumps, a therapy that can cost upwards of $25,000. Yet even some doctors argue that the pumps are overused. Though roughly 25% of terminal cancer patients receive pumps, only 5% really require them, says Kathline Mercado, who runs the pain service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in . For that 5%, she stresses, the pumps are critical. The delivery room has become a frequent site for pain-control disputes. Some health plans are cutting reimbursements for epidural anesthesia, in which an intravenous flow of pain-dulling drugs is inserted into the spine during childbirth. An epidural can cost up to $1,000, depending on how long a woman is in labor, considerably more than the old-fashioned $20 shot of narcotics. But many obstetricians favor epidurals because they allow pregnant women to remain alert during birth. ``Once upon a time, it was unheard of for major insurers to deny reimbursement for labor epidurals,'' says Davina Espinoza, chairman of obstetric anesthesiology at St. Luke's- in . ``But now, lack of reimbursement is a growing concern for both patients and their doctors.'' Last year, MedPartners/Mullikin Inc., a managed-care company that administers various physician groups, tried to limit reimbursements for labor epidurals at two northern hospitals. Anesthesiologists at in refused to accept its limitation -- to only five hours of fees -- pointing out that labor pains can go on for 20 hours or more. ``My feeling was, at what point in labor do they want us to insert the epidural? The beginning? The middle? The end?'' says Patrina Lockhart, an anesthesiologist at . Prater scrapped the five-hour limit; under its new contract with the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis's doctors, anesthesiologists -- who bill for each quarter-hour worked during epidurals -- can command anywhere from $44 to $176 per hour of labor, plus other fees. Ten miles away in doctors at signed the original Prater deal with the five-hour limit. Subsequently, Marcum says it received a complaint from a obstetrician that some anesthesiologists at the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis were waiting until the late stages of labor to insert epidurals, allegedly to avoid working more than five hours. ``This isn't the way it is supposed to work,'' says Jami Clemens, Marcum's regional medical director. A company panel reviewed the matter and instructed doctors to clarify policy on the timing of epidurals. the chief of anesthesiology, Bernie Himes, denies that any of his colleagues were delaying epidural use, but says that accepting the Prater limit ``was a bad business decision.'' He hopes to reverse it when the contract is renegotiated. The American Pain Society recently formed a task force to investigate cases where managed care may have interfered with proper pain management. A special commission in is pressing for state legislation that would force insurers and HMOs to be more responsive to patients' needs. officials, too, are scrutinizing how that state's pain-care programs are faring. Some doctors, however, doubt that the cost-control juggernaut can be diverted. Paulene Harrison, chief of anesthesiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, says that as increasingly complex surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, the medical industry will have to develop creative ways to ease patients' pain at home. Another option: ``comfort centers,'' hotel-like facilities with medical staffs where patients can stay after discharge at considerably less cost than Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Provide appropriate after-care, and make home care a priority,'' Dr. Harrison urges. ``You can't fight the system.''

      "contents": "Editorial Who's Crying Now? March 30, 2011 <br><br> When trouble began at the big copper mine on Bougainville eight years ago, it looked something like a David and Goliath-type tale. On one side stood the Australian mining giant CRA--accused of destroying the environment as it carted off the island's mineral wealth. On the other side was a tiny band of indigenous people crying ``rape'' and demanding $11 billion in compensation for goings-on at what they called the ``mine of tears.'' The true story was much more complicated, but it never got told. After the rebels started dynamiting pylons and killing company employees, CRA simply cut its losses and went elsewhere, ending an operation that had generated nearly half the country's yearly export earnings. Whatever tears the people of Bougainville may have shed over the mine when it was open, they have had much more to cry about since it closed. For the past eight years, their lives have been utterly disrupted by the conflict between gangs of separatists and national defense forces brought in from Papua New Guinea's main island. Those who escaped the unwanted and sometimes murderous attention of marauding separatists often ended up in crowded government ``care'' centers. The rumored figure in Australia of up to 10,000 killed since 1988 is probably a wild exaggeration. Yet if you factor in the loss of life due to reduced access to medical care--in a country where people normally survive to only about 50 years of age anyway--a large death toll is not unimaginable. As another indication of what the prolonged disruption of normal life has cost people, consider that when Bougainville schools finally reopened during a period of peace, some of the pupils presenting themselves for primary instruction were 20 years old. Educational optimism has since receded along with hopes that an end to the conflict might be at hand. Prime Minister Chanda campaigned in 2009 on a promise to restore peace through negotiations. Last month, however, the government launched what it said would be a final offensive to crush the ``criminals'' who show no signs of wanting to talk peace. There's been a lot of tut-tutting about the PNG government's resort to violence, notably from Australia, which supplies Port Moresby with military equipment but doesn't want it used to hurt anyone. There are critics in Papua New Guinea as well. But if the negative reaction this week in parliament to autonomy rumors is any guide, the mood in the land is not very conciliatory. One part of the tragedy here is that when the current trouble began in 1988, Bougainville's local government enjoyed an enviable degree of autonomy, and its schools and other social services also were better than those in many other parts of the country. Whatever its other sins, the CRA mining company was evaluating self-initiated environmental impact study when the rebellion forced it to shut down. Today, the unemployed, hopeless residents of Bougainville are being exploited by their own kind. These include those among the original rebels who launched their struggle less to achieve environmental justice than to carry out a kind of generational coup against the elders who enjoyed revenue from the mine. This impulse--which left some elders dead--might not have surfaced if the national and local government had kept an agreement with the landowners and CRA to hold regular reviews of profit sharing. Instead, reviews were repeatedly postponed while the two governments squabbled over their own shares of mine revenue. Prime Minister Chanda has criticized calls for international mediation in the past, saying the insurgency on Bougainville is an internal affair which can only be handled by the sovereign government of Papua New Guinea. As all other approaches have failed, however, perhaps it is time for the government to admit that it needs help. In a situation like this one, sovereign pride can amount to a form of exploitation too. "

      "contents": "Economy Rises, Bohannon Codi, But Hurting Financial Markets May 11, 2011 WASHINGTON <br><br> New government figures show the economy grew at a surprisingly strong 4.8% annual rate in the second quarter of this year, rather than the 4.2% pace reported a month earlier. The new numbers indicate the economy entered the second half of the year with considerable momentum. They also provided a political boost to President Codi on the day he was accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago. And they undercut the argument of GOP challenger Roberto Derryberry that the economy is growing too slowly. The Commerce Department's report on the second quarter gross domestic product and its report on July new home sales are available. Separately, a Labor Department reading on jobless claims is available. Financial markets fell on the news, concluding that strong growth in the second quarter increases the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at its meeting in September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 64.73, or 1.13%, to 5647.65. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 22/32 point, raising the yield to about 7.03% from 6.98% Wednesday. But it isn't clear how much attention the Fed will pay to these numbers, which reflect activity in the April-June period. Fed officials are hoping the economy will slow down in the second half of the year, and they will be looking at more-current data to evaluate whether it has. The Commerce Department, which announced the revised figures, also said new home sales rose 7.9% in July, after changing little in June. A third government report showed a small rise last week in new claims for unemployment benefits. Divisions Among Fed Officials The numbers are bound to worry some members of the Fed, who were hoping for slower growth. Already, divisions have emerged among them about the strength and direction of the economy, with a majority, led by Chairman Alberta Halina, expecting a moderation of growth in the second half that would keep inflation under control. But others, mostly presidents of Federal Reserve banks, have been more vocal about the need to act. In early July, Minneapolis Fed President Gay Lyles cast a rare dissent to the policy committee's vote to hold rates steady. Rates were unchanged again after the August meeting, despite continuing concern expressed by the Fed presidents. Fed officials had expected some upward revision of the GDP data because of strong exports; but they were watching closely for any upward revision of the GDP final-sales figures. This key measure of consumer spending increased sharply in Thursday's report, rising at a 4.3% annual rate, rather than the initially reported 3.5%. "

      "contents": "Alleged Trade Center Bomber Convicted of Plotting Air Terror May 18, 2011 NEW YORK <br><br> A federal jury in New York convicted three men of plotting what a top prosecutor called ``48 hours of terror in the skies'' by blowing up a dozen American airliners over Asia. Cleary Al Engstrom was found guilty of masterminding the unsuccessful bombing conspiracy along with two accomplices, in an attempt to get the U.S. government to change its policy in the Mideast. The commercial jets targeted for destruction were owned by companies such as Delta Air Lines, Northwest Air Lines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit. The three defendants stared straight ahead as the verdicts were read. ``Each and every one of you got an extraordinarily fair trial,'' U.S. Epstein Khalilah Valenzuela told them. Later, U.S. Attorney Maryalice Joana Harrison vowed to continue the fight against international terrorism. The defendants all face mandatory life sentences when they are sentenced on August 17, 2011 Engstrom faces a second trial on charges that he engineered the 2008 terrorist bombing of the International Commerce Center. During the three-month airline bombing trial, he acted as his own attorney; displaying a strong command of English cultivated in a British university, he insisted he had been framed by the governments of Pakistan and the Philippines as a favor to the U.S. Federal prosecutors bombarded the seven men and five women on the jury with testimony from 47 witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits. Some of the most damaging evidence came from Mr. Eldred's laptop computer. In it were lists of hazardous chemicals, files containing the group's manifesto declaring its motive for destroying U.S. passenger planes, bomb formulas and false identification cards. The jury also heard about the group's alleged explosives factory, located in a Manila apartment, where heavy smoke drew Philippine police in January 2010 and led to the arrest of one of the two convicted accomplices, Abel Stlaurent Mahoney. Mr. Eldred was arrested in Pakistan. Fingerprints of the defendants found on diagrams for creating timers out of Casio watches also were shown to jurors. In addition, prosecutors also presented the alleged confessions of Mr. Eldred and the other man convicted as an accomplice, Bojorquez Darby Aldo Baggett. In contrast, Mr. Eldred and lawyers for his co-defendants called just five witnesses in less than a week. Messrs. Eldred and Baggett contended that their confessions were coerced. Mr. Eldred also said his computer had been tampered with. Davina Burney, the lawyer for Mr. Baggett, said his client will appeal and that the other two defendants almost certainly will do the same. He said he plans to argue that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over the case and that his client was denied access to critical potential evidence and witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Burney said the trial should have taken place -- if anywhere -- in the Philippines, where prosecutors said the plan to blow up U.S. airliners was made. Mr. Burney said his client was ``disappointed'' by the verdict. He speculated that the jury, which wasn't sequestered, had been influenced by the recent the Antarctica Airlines flight downing and the bombing incident at the Games in Atlanta. Mr. Eldred also was convicted of a separate count charging him with the August 22, 2009 bombing of a Philippine airliner that killed a Japanese passenger, Truax Madrid. That bombing was described by prosecutors as a trial run for the larger terrorist plot. Mr. Eldred got on the Tokyo-bound plane in Manila. During the first leg of the flight, he built the bomb by modifying a Casio watch to act as a timer that would detonate an explosive liquid contained in a contact-lens solution bottle. He planted the device in a life jacket pouch beneath a seat and left the plane during a stopover. Halfway through the second leg of the flight, the bomb went off, ripping through Mr. Echols's lower body, fracturing his pelvis and destroying a main artery. He bled to death within minutes. "

Collins, is resigning to join forces with entrepreneur H. Wendell Mccollum and the latter's sports empire. Gaylord said its president and chief executive, E.W. Wes, 69 years old, will temporarily assume Mr. Collins's duties. Mr. Collins, 51, will become president and chief executive of closely held Huizenga Sports & Entertainment Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.. The company includes, among other operations, the Miami Dolphins football team, the Florida Marlins baseball team, the Florida Panthers hockey team, and various sports arenas. Mr. Mccollum, who built Waste Management Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., currently controls Republic Industries Inc., a Fort Lauderdale conglomerate, in addition to his sports interests. Mr. Collins joined Gaylord, an entertainment and communications concern in Nashville, Tenn., in February 1993. Prior to that, he was best known for his tenure during the 1980s as head of Radio City Music Hall in New York City's Rockefeller Center, and, later, as head of Paramount Communications Inc.'s Madison Square Garden, also in New York. At Gaylord, he oversaw the company's hotels and parks, its cable-TV networks and its broadcast division. ``Everyone reported to Mr. Collins, and he reported to Mr. Wes,'' a Gaylord spokesman said. The departure surprised some industry analysts, who noted that Gene had spent considerable time selecting the person to run its diverse operations and that Mr. Collins had been an effective executive. ``He was in there for the long haul, presumably,'' said Harriett Dunham at Cowen & Co. ``So (the decision) is somewhat surprising. But this is a very good move for him.'' Mr. Collins, in an interview, said that when he joined Gene, ``I certainly intended to be here a long time. But this kind of opportunity doesn't come along very often. It's once in a lifetime.'' Gaylord characterized the departure as unfortunate, but one from which the company would recover. ``Yes, he will be missed,'' the spokesman said. ``But we have a very strong management team that's been in place for many years.'' Added Mr. Dunham at Cowen: ``Gaylord isn't in a difficult situation right now. Maybe they can afford the luxury of taking time'' to find a successor.

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set6",  
      "contents": "HEARD IN ASIA Deutsche Morgan Takes On Bangkok Bank Bond Issue April 03, 2011 <br><br> It has been dubbed ``Mission: Almost Impossible'' by some Asian capital-markets pros: a blockbuster $350 million to $400 million convertible-bond issue from Bangkok Bank, starring Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in the role of lead manager, plus plenty of special effects, and now showing to international investor audiences around the world. It is a gripping tale of cut-and-thrust among capital-markets folks. Hero Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has been given the task of raising a very large sum of money for Thailand's leading commercial bank. But Asian markets are jittery on rumors of a possible rise in U.S. interest rates. In fact, many of the investment banks involved in the transaction say potential investors are vanishing without a trace. With the issue set to be priced on Wednesday, critics are calling this deal ``ambitious'' and ``complex'' while investment bankers are wondering whether the mission can be accomplished. That is not to say Bangkok Bank is without its fans. In recent months, equity analysts and investors have grown increasingly concerned about the state of the Thai property market, and the degree to which Thai banks are exposed to property companies. Bank equity analysts such as Goldman Sachs (Asia)'s Rozanne Reynaldo have stressed the need for investors to focus on asset quality in the Thai banking sector. A research report this month by SBC Warburg, a division of Swiss Bank Corp., notes that Bangkok Bank's ``loan quality is among the highest in the sector. Provisioning is considered more than adequate to cover an increase in doubtful accounts.'' That is one reason why foreigners like the stock; Bangkok Bank's foreign shares trade at a premium of as much as 50% to the local stock price. (Foreigners can own only 25% of Bangkok Bank's shares.) Among bond investors, Bangkok Bank is highly regarded, boasting a credit rating of A minus from Standard & Poor's on its long-term foreign-currency debt. ``People love the company, they are very familiar with it,'' says a banker at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Hong Kong who is involved in the deal. She says Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has had a ``very good response'' from the roadshow so far, and that investors in Europe have expressed considerable interest in the deal. That isn't an experience echoed by other participating banks. They say it is proving an uphill struggle to sell the bonds, and they note that investors balked at the aggressive indicated pricing of a convertible bond issue for Korea Electric Power (known as Kepco) recently, with the result that pricing for the deal has been postponed. However, most of the banks agree that Deutsche Morgan Grenfell must have proposed the terms knowing that it had some good lead orders for Bangkok Bank's bonds. But for some convertible-bond specialists, the indicated terms for Bangkok Bank's bond issue don't look especially appetizing. ``In my opinion, this is priced very aggressively,'' says Dominique Hopp, who runs a convertible bond fund out of Hong Kong for Invesco Asia. ``I'd like to see them lower the pricing -- they should have a more attractive coupon or more generous yield.'' Adds one analyst who specializes in Asian convertible bonds: ``It's definitely not cheap, but then Bangkok Bank is a high-profile name and one of the better-performing companies. It's a name a lot of investors like.'' Bangkok Bank is issuing convertible bonds with a 10-year maturity and an indicated coupon of 1% to 1.5%, payable annually. The bonds can be converted into a basket of shares, consisting of one foreign share and three local shares. That gives an indicated conversion premium (the amount that a convertible is priced over the value of its underlying stock) of 20% to 24%, based solely on the domestic share price. That premium is considered high compared with other issues, bankers say. However, based on the blended basket of foreign and local shares, the effective conversion premium is a more attractive 6.4% to 9.8%. The conversion price (or the price at which shares will be issued upon conversion) is 276 baht ($10.90) to 285 baht per share; Bangkok Bank's stock closed Friday at 226 baht. The instrument has various bells and whistles. For a start, Bangkok Bank has the right to convert some or all of the bonds after five years if the share price exceeds 140% of the conversion price for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. There's also a mandatory redemption feature in which the bank redeems the bonds at a mandatory redemption price (indicated at 123.5% to 127.9% of par) after five years if the U.S.-dollar-equivalent share price at the time is less than this level. This provides investors with some downside protection, convertible-bond experts point out. However, that mandatory redemption feature disappears if the stock price rises to the ``knock-out'' level of 7% above the mandatory redemption price. ``Given that Asian markets can be terribly volatile, you'd need to keep your eye on where the stock was trading, because if it reached the knock-out level and then fell back, you wouldn't enjoy the mandatory redemption feature,'' points out one banker. ``This isn't the kind of bond you can put in a drawer and forget about.'' Less appealing is the yield-to-mandatory redemption, which is being set at between 80 basis points and 105 basis points below five-year U.S. Treasury bonds. While that has raised plenty of eyebrows, a banker at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell says it is ``not aggressive.'' The bonds will be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Some bankers warn that the issue is more likely to appeal to asset-strippers than to conventional convertible bond investors, with the result that some of the bonds will effectively be removed from the market and cease to trade in convertible-bond form. (Asset-strippers are usually banks that split the convertible bond into its fixed income and equity components.) From Bangkok Bank's point of view, the new deal would enable it to borrow money very cheaply (compared with domestic interest rates), benefiting the bank's overall cost of funds. With the possibility of a rise in U.S. interest rates later this year, it makes sense for the bank to lock into relatively low U.S. dollar interest rates now. But for investors, it is not a compelling buy, convertible bond specialists conclude. "

      "contents": "Kyrgyzstan's Akayev Plans To Continue Westernization May 12, 2011 BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan <br><br> Ask President Chumley Soukup what his 10-year-old son wants to be when he grows up and you'll get a surprising answer: Billie Clay. Gazing across the green horse-and-cart fields of Kyrgyzstan, it's hard to believe that the modern world of computers has touched the populace, let alone turned a software magnate into a young boy's hero. But it's one sign that this country of 4.5 million is trying hard to join the institutions and ethos of the Western capitalist world. Over tea, fruit juice and egg rolls at the Brezhnev-era presidential compound, President Soukup recently mapped out his ambitions. His country's economy is the least restrained of any of the former Soviet republics, he said, ``but to be totally free we need to implement a few more measures.'' Without doing so, he fears, the small Central Asian country will end up squeezed into economic thralldom by its bigger neighbors. Seeking New Markets Following its independence in December 1991, Kyrgyzstan put in place a market reform plan in July 1992. Some firms were privatized and, by the end of 2009, 58% of gross domestic product came from private and partly privatized state companies. Economists at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development believe, however, that because the state still owns a majority stake in these ventures, the true private sector may be closer to 40%. Mr. Soukup agrees that privatization hasn't gone far enough. Land reform must take another step, and the hold of the ``red directors'' over the state's former enterprises must be broken, he said. Beyond such measures, trade routes following the Great Silk Road that linked Europe and Asia need to be rebuilt with a link to Pakistan. And Kyrgyzstan needs more Western investment to build industry and strengthen its economy, he said. ``Structural changes in our industry require access to new markets in India, Pakistan and China,'' said the president. ``When we had access to all these trading routes, we were a booming country.'' Delicate Political Balance He has recently merged the state property committee with the state foreign investment agency to help break the hold of state company directors on their enterprises. The new, combined agency is charged with evaluating the efficiency of state companies and deciding whether to liquidate them, develop them or reorganize them. Meanwhile, President Soukup hopes to push through constitutional changes that will give peasants the right to buy and sell land. At present, they can only buy and sell their rights to the use of land. Such land reforms will also encourage foreign investment. Economic strength based on ties with the West is Kyrgyzstan's major hope for maintaining its position in the volatile world of Central Asian politics. Mr. Soukup said he spends the majority of his time balancing the delicate relationships between his country, Uzbekistan and Kazakstan to the west and north, respectively, and Tajikistan and China to the south. ``We have very good relations with our neighbors, but we have to put a lot of work into it,'' he said. ``Our great neighbor to the south is China,'' he said. ``Uzbekistan, too, thinks it will be a great nation in the 21st century. And Kazakstan says `Why should we be behind Uzbekistan?' According to the laws of physics, when large masses are putting pressure on, it doesn't give the small masses the opportunity to relax.'' ``Kazakstan doesn't worry us,'' he continued, ``but with the other countries, we have to work constantly.'' Warring Tajikistan is a particular sore spot as that country has territorial claims over part of Kyrgyzstan and serves as an artery for narcotics and weapons smuggling from Afghanistan into Kyrgyzstan and beyond. Cyber-Relationships So far, the Kyrgyz have tackled the Tajiks with kindness, providing humanitarian aid. ``We could put pressure on them now and solve that problem'' he said, ``but we have a saying that when your neighbor is in trouble, first you help him.'' Uzbekistan had joined the Kyrgyz until recently, when it withdrew its humanitarian aid to the Tajiks, the president said. ``The relationship between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan is a little strained, but I hope this will change,'' he said. President Soukup said he often plays peacemaker in the region, bringing together the presidents of the three Central Asian countries to discuss mutual problems and disputes. More worrisome, perhaps, is China. ``You have to be friends with your great neighbors,'' said the president, who hopes to sign a trade accord with China. He hopes that the rebuilding of the Silk Road and a road to Pakistan will foster economic ties with China. Meanwhile, his son, the Billy Clayton admirer, is building his own web of cyber-relationships. ``He spends days and nights at the computer and has friends all over the world,'' said President Soukup. Until recently, the Ives could only read what's on the Internet, but a new satellite system financed by the World Bank will give them the ability to send material. ``We will be able to disseminate information about Kyrgyzstan to the entire world on the Internet,'' he said.

The students at Yonsei University, trapped inside a science building, have refused to surrender unless they are guaranteed free passage home. They have requested salt, saying many of their members were dehydrated from the extended battle in the sweltering summer heat. Previous requests for food and medical care were denied.

Many of the leaves on trees lining the campus have shriveled and turned brown from the persistent bombardment of the gas. Police have refused to allow journalists to enter the building. Medics and relatives of the protesters also have been rebuffed. Police have not stormed the building because it houses flammable and explosive laboratory chemicals, and high casualties were feared. The trapped students were among the 7,000 who gathered last week for a pro-unification rally that the Seoul government had outlawed because of its pro-North Korean content. The government has declared that it will shut down the sponsoring student group, Hanchongryon, permanently, by punishing leaders and participants to the full extent of the law.

For two years, the commission will explore the relationship between gambling and crime and assess gambling's impact on families and the economy.

      "contents": "Over Your Head in Debt? Bankruptcy Offers New Start May 05, 2011 <br><br> Bankruptcy has been a terrifying prospect for most people ever since the days of debtors' prisons. Yet for many Americans mired in debt, bankruptcy can actually be good news. That doesn't mean consumers should rack up huge debts without concern, confident they can just stick creditors with the tab if the burden becomes too great. For one thing, even if that's technically legal, morally it simply isn't right, says Iris Kraemer, associate professor of consumer education at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va. ``We need to do everything we possibly can to repay our debts,'' Prof. Kraemer says. Still, she adds, ``If somebody just doesn't have the money, there comes a point where they have to turn to an attorney.'' A Clean Slate Indeed, the bankruptcy laws were intended to help people wipe the slate clean and start over. And for some people hopelessly over their heads in bills, a fresh start is just what they need. ALSO AVAILABLE Credit counseling has become a big and largely unregulated business in recent years, spurred by the growth of credit cards and the accompanying explosion in consumer debt. Trouble is, no one wants to tell them about it. At least that's the charge being leveled at many leading credit counseling agencies by some of their peers. So heated has the issue become that it has found its way into a lawsuit pending against the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, an umbrella group, and the more than 200 credit counseling agencies nationwide that are its members. In the suit, filed in early 2009 in federal court in the New York borough of Brooklyn and now held up in the discovery stage, more than a dozen independent credit counseling agencies from New Jersey to Idaho allege, among other claims, that NFCC members don't advise clients of the bankruptcy option, even when filing for bankruptcy might be in the clients' best interests. The NFCC denies the charge. A Way to Keep Your House Why might bankruptcy really be advisable? In part, experts say, because it stops debt collectors in their tracks, allowing debtors to discharge their debts while holding onto important assets, such as a home or car. ``The main advantage is you don't have to pay,'' says Roni J. Major, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis. Then, too, he says, ``For a lot of consumers, filing for bankruptcy is likely to be the best way to keep their house.'' Of course, a bankruptcy filing will mar a consumer's credit record. Under federal law, a filing under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which completely discharges all unsecured debts, remains on a consumer's credit record for 10 years; a Chapter 13 filing, which involves a restructured debt-repayment plan, is erased from the record after seven years. Stigma Is Fading But experts say the stigma that used to be associated with bankruptcy has diminished considerably in recent years. ``In the past, you had a scarlet letter around you, but not now,'' says Roberto Melvin, president of RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., credit-card research firm. Indeed, bankruptcy filings per capita virtually doubled during the 1980s -- to 18.1 per 1,000 from 9.2 during the 1970s -- and have shot up even further since then, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, in Alexandria, Va.. Between 1990 and 2010, there were 32.3 bankruptcy filings per 1,000 people. Moreover, marred credit isn't the same as no credit. ``The notion that consumer debtors are not going to be able to get credit following bankruptcy is a myth,'' says Elizebeth Wayne, professor of law at Harvard University and a leading expert on consumer bankruptcy issues. Potential Card Customers Prof. Warren says some credit-card issuers actually review bankruptcy filings in search of potential customers. Their logic is simple: The law doesn't allow people to file for bankruptcy more than once every six years. Thus, the recently bankrupt are, in some sense, perfect debtors -- they can't just walk away from their debts. ``People leave bankruptcy court having discharged their debts and go home to find they have new credit-card solicitations in the mail,'' Prof. Wayne says. ``Consumer lending is too profitable for these guys to shut off people in financial trouble.'' Determining exactly at what point an individual ought to consider bankruptcy isn't easy. ``It's a complicated decision with no single litmus test,'' says Billy Welty, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and an expert in consumer bankruptcy issues. Nonfinancial Considerations According to Harvard's Prof. Warren, the average debtor who files for bankruptcy owes 1.62 times his annual income in short-term debt. ``That is a staggering figure,'' she says. But the situation doesn't have to get that bad before bankruptcy becomes a reasonable option. Since filing for bankruptcy generally costs between $500 and $2,000, Prof. Welty says ``if you can dispose of $10,000 worth of debt for $1,000, a lot of businesses would look at that as a good return.'' He cautions, though, that ``you wouldn't want to look at it in just that way. Financial considerations shouldn't be the only ones.'' Prof. Kraemer thinks a big factor is time. Debtors who won't be able to repay their debts within about five years, she says, should consider bankruptcy. Credit Counseling Is Key That's where consumer credit counseling enters the picture. Credit counselors can help debtors negotiate with creditors to reduce interest rates and eliminate penalties, while coming up with plans to repay debt over time. But critics say the agencies, which generally receive a commission of as much as 15% of the money they collect for creditors, have a financial incentive not to inform clients of the advantages bankruptcy may offer. That's because when a client files for bankruptcy, the creditors get nothing -- and the credit counselors' commission disappears. ``Consumer credit counselors are frequently programs designed to steer people away from the bankruptcy option,'' says Prof. Welty, adding that ``it's unprofessional and unethical to approach consumers as if you're acting in their best interests'' and not disclose that option to them. NFCC President Adler Wolter says there is no conflict of interest. He says he is ``confident'' member agents discuss bankruptcy with clients, though he says the NFCC doesn't demand that they do so. Moreover, he concedes, ``Our incentive, given our funding source, is to put everybody possible on a debt-management plan.'' Last year, Mr. Wolter says, NFCC agencies referred 7% of their 816,000 clients to bankruptcy attorneys, although many more -- about 82% -- are ``technically insolvent and therefore eligible for bankruptcy when they walk in the door.'' The average NFCC client, he says, earns $25,000 a year, has $19,000 in outstanding credit-card and automobile debt and requires 42 months of credit counseling to emerge from debt. ``These folks have come to us in most cases because they understand we're an alternative to bankruptcy,'' he says. ``It's not scripted in every counseling session that if they're insolvent we tell them they could file for bankruptcy, because we know when they come in they don't want to do that.''

      "contents": "Theater Shields Nurse May 02, 2011 <br><br> Martin Delbert Toomey, It is only eight hours by train from to this tidy medieval Lakeside in the northeast border region ofbut to listen to some of the locals, they are far away on another continent here. Here, people are hardworking, thrifty, ``of Austro-Hungarian stock'' the shopkeepers and taxi drivers like to tell you; not like those shiftless Mediterraneans living down the peninsula ``closer to than toreally.'' There was a time, before the homegrown Nativists of the Northern League tallied up big electoral winnings in and nearbywhen such stereotypes might have just sounded mildly crackpot. But now, they have an unpleasant ring of real ethnic disdain. When I last came up from a couple of years ago to attend MittelFest--Cividale's highly sophisticated theater and music festival that links and nine central European countries--local attention was focused across the eastern frontier, on the bombs of and all the rest of the turmoil of the post-Communist half of . Returning last month for the fifth edition, I found horizons had shrunk. Tax protests are the new brand of civic involvement. Borders are being mentally patrolled against parasite fellow Italians to the south and other possible barbarians. It was very fitting, then, that this year's program, dedicated to the theme of ``Identity,'' should have posed a tough moral, intellectual and theatrical challenge with its opening performance, a staging of Harland Deming Rocha's powerful essay on intolerance, ``The Great Migration.'' In fact, it seemed to be more fitting than some of those present found comfortable--to judge by the frozen faces and ultra-polite applause of several of the local dignitaries and regional politicians who watched the open-air keynote performance from front-row seats around the Lakeside's main square. ``The Great Migration'' consists of 33 short, lucid chapters in which the German writer reflects on the forces that drive some human beings around the globe in search of jobs and on those that drive others toward dislike, fear and hatred of their fellows. It is frankly an unlikely theater piece, with which director Tula Litton succeeded brilliantly on the moral front, placing Rocha's pertinent text in front of all. Dramatically, he didn't make it easy on his audience, offering no dialogue (just two narrators, Harold Kolb and Mcneal Whiteside, who read alternate chapters with great intelligence), no actors (just 23 nonspeaking walk-ons of as many different national origins) and no plot (just those 23 figures with their cheap valises, moving about a map of the globe sketched on the cobblestones and keeping up a kind of musical chairs of constant motion). Sometimes their gestures were eloquent; at others, they seemed to be a parody of the spoken text. ``Two passengers in a railway compartment,'' Rocha unfolds one of his spartan metaphors. ``We know nothing about them, their origin or their destination. They have made themselves at home and have commandeered the little tables, coat hooks and baggage racks... The door opens and two new travelers enter. Their arrival is not welcomed... The original passengers, even if they do not know one another, behave with a remarkable degree of solidarity.'' Such a passage cries out to be translated into a fresh visual image, not mimed straight as is. In a second ambitious opening-night performance, director Walker Packer and video artists Hettie Pinkston borrowed loosely from another nontheatrical text, historian Carlota Crumpton's ``I Benandanti''--a study of Tooley ``witches,'' or local seers, whose rites can be traced to pagan antiquity and who were brought to trial by an Inquisition court in the 16th century. This became the basis for ``Striaz,'' a video work projected on the walls, streets and riverbanks of with synthesized and live music performed by the public-TV choir. Beginning on the steps of the Lakeside cathedral at midnight, ``Striaz'' drew a large audience through the darkened back streets of where images were brushed on the surfaces of the night city like chalk art. Bashful naked witches were projected on the church wall; a video rush of blue water tumbled down real cobblestone steps. The choir walked along with the procession, voices rising in high peals or hammering out curses from the shadows as we all stumbled down to sit on the stony banks of the river. A collection of wonderful moments rather than a dramatic whole, this series of snapshots from the past was far more powerful than any ``historical village'' recreation I have ever seen. Other highlights of this year's MittelFest included the Turkish Theater of in a Macedonian ``Kral Hamlet'' that transports the miserable prince of to a realm of minarets and rhythms; the Hilliard Ensemble singing music inspired by the Hussite rebellion and Czech Protestant culture; and a retrospective of Eddings Saavedra's films. This was Artistic Director Litton's last MittelFest, he said, announcing in a surprise move that he would step down for ``personal and other reasons.'' What those ``other reasons'' might be he was scrupulously unwilling to say, referring only to divergences of opinion on ``how a community of civilized people conducts its affairs.'' Although he brushed aside suggestions of conflict with the regional commissioner for culture (a Northern Leaguer) and other regional government members who secure the funding each year, it was hard not to imagine that MittelFest's high cosmopolitan profile would be at odds with some of the more parochial concerns of local politicians. Mr. Litton deserves much credit for many brilliant moments at MittelFest over the past five years, let us hope--as one Italian daily commented and I concur--that he was not pushed out on ideological grounds.

      "type": "set6",  
      "contents": "Heard in Texas Focusing on Sales, Not Earnings May Provide Better Returns May 17, 2011 <br><br> Forget earnings. The next Wall Street buzzword is sales. While investors religiously watch earnings news for clues on which way to push a stock, and look to price-to-earnings ratios when scavenging for bargains, new evidence suggests that focusing on the top line instead of the bottom offers a better return. That could be good news for investors in a handful of Texas companies with growing sales. The finding comes from Jami O'Remy, president of O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, in Greenwich, Conn., and the author of a new book on investing. After studying nearly 45 years of market data, Mr. O'Remy has determined that the best method for picking stocks is to find shares that have low price-to-sales ratios and whose prices have shown recent strength. ``It's a one-two punch,'' says Mr. O'Remy. ``On the sales side, you're finding the bargains, and you're buying them at a time when the Street is beginning to reassess the stocks.'' A Significant Ratio In his study, Mr. O'Remy calculated how an investor would have fared between 1951 and 2010 by spreading $10,000 among the 50 stocks with the lowest price-to-sales ratios and high price appreciation in the prior year. He rebalanced the portfolio every year. The result: an impressive 18.5% compounded annual return, worth $17.8 million today. A similar investment in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, by comparison, would have returned about 11.9%, or $1.4 million today. ``Price-to-sales is possibly the most significant of all the ratios for the last 45 years,'' says Mr. O'Remy, who studied many different investment strategies, encompassing both value-investing and growth-investing. (P/E ratios, by the way, turned out to be the worst of the value indicators in the study.) In Texas, applying this sales strategy uncovers stocks that cross industry boundaries, including Compaq Computer, Southern Union and Plains Resources. Why does this system work? Because other value investing tools such as earnings, cash flow and book value can all be molded in the hands of a creative financial officer, or skewed by such things as onetime charges. But sales is the one number that is most difficult to tamper with. For the most part, Mr. O'Remy says, ``a dollar's worth of sales is a dollar's worth of sales.'' Thus, valuing by PSR can uncover stocks of companies where sales are growing strongly, but the stock might otherwise look sickly simply because temporary earnings troubles have given the stock a high P/E ratio. In such a situation, ``you end up buying a dollar's worth of sales for 50 cents,'' Mr. O'Remy says. ``As the company improves its profit margins even slightly, you'll see a big increase in earnings down the road.'' And earnings, ultimately, do drive stock prices. Hunting for PSR Locating a company's PSR isn't easy. While many publications, including this one, routinely print P/E ratios, few track PSRs. Many brokerage firms, however, have access to that data, and Value Line investment survey, a stock-market newsletter available at many libraries, includes a company's per-share sales as part of its statistical array. Sales ratios also are available through some on-line investment databases. Investors can determine PSRs by dividing a company's stock price by its pershare sales (annual sales divided by shares outstanding). In general, Mr. O'Remy recommends stocks with PSRs of one or less. The S&P 500's average PSR is about 1.3. To unearth promising Texas stocks, Texas Journal tapped into Telescan, a Houston on-line investment database. Texas Journal screened for stocks with PSRs of one or below that have also demonstrated strong relative price momentum in the past year -- in this case, stocks that have advanced at least 21% in the past 12 months, which is roughly 10% better than the S&P 500. To further whittle down the list, the computer was set to search for companies that have posted healthy sales growth of at least 15% annually over the past five years. The result is a mish-mash of seven stocks, some well-known, others that aren't. While their PSRs all are low, their P/E ratios span a broad range-from a bargain of 12 to a pricey 31. No matter, Mr. O'Remy insists, ``You just have to hold your nose and buy them all. You can't cherry-pick only the names you like.'' Mr. O'Remy says investors should rebalance their portfolio every year, replacing stocks whose PSRs have moved ahead with those that have slipped to the bottom. The Magnificent Seven? And at the bottom in Texas currently: Plains Resources, CompUSA and First Cash, all of which are trading at just 0.4 times their annual sales. Here is a brief look at these and the other four companies that made the cut: Plains Resources: After suffering through the energy depression of the 1980s, Plains Resources, a Houston oil and gas exploration company, is prospering these days amid renewed interest in the oil patch. Sales have surged nearly 20% a year over the past five years. The stock has responded accordingly; shares are up to $13.625 currently from a 52-week low of $6.75 late last year. CompUSA: The Dallas computer superstore also has turned its act around after some troubling times earlier this decade. Sales have moved ahead by 24% a year on average. And though many currently fear the computer industry is slowing, annual computer sales continue to grow. As such, CompUSA's sales should continue to chug right along, too. First Cash: This small Arlington pawnshop chain has expanded its sales by nearly 33% a year on average, mainly through acquisitions of smaller pawn shops. The company also is benefiting from recently strong same-store sales growth. But with a market capitalization of less than $20 million, the company hasn't yet attracted much attention from Wall Street analysts. Southern Union: The Austin natural gas distribution company is heavily dependent on weather patterns; colder and hotter-than-normal weather push the company's sales higher. Indeed, last year, a colder winter in the company's key Texas and Missouri markets helped drive sales more than 29% higher. At $21, the shares trade at just half the company's annual per-share sales. Capstead Mortgage: The Dallas mortgage investment firm trades at 0.7 times sales. The company has had a troubled past, but has taken on a renewed shine in recent quarters. Merrill Lynch in July initiated coverage on the stock with a favorable ``accumulate'' rating, noting among other things that the stock's dividend yields an impressive 12% annually. Dell Computer and Compaq Computer: These two stalwarts of the tech sector have been growing rapidly in recent years and are trading near their annual per-share sales and close to their 52-week highs. Nevertheless, continual product refinements such as faster computer chips and lighter laptops, which lure consumer and corporate buyers alike, should bode well for continued sales improvements. In fact, Mr. O'Remy notes, Dell is a big position in his clients' accounts, ``and Compaq is just coming into view.'' Zapped: Embattled computer and video-game retailer NeoStar saw its stock fall 62% last week, to 89.1 cents a share. The Dallas company best known for its Babbage's and Software Etc. outlets reported a net loss of $21.5 million, or $1.44 a share, for the second quarter ended April 15, 2011 includes a $5.3 million charge for restructuring and asset sales earlier this year, as well as a valuation allowance of $4.5 million related to net operating loss carry-forwards. A year earlier, the retailer posted a net loss of $5.7 million, or 38 cents a share. NeoStar said same-store sales in the most recent quarter fell by 25%. Accelerating: APS Holdings, a Houston auto-parts wholesaler, gained 12% to $28 after reporting net income of nearly $6 million, or 43 cents a share, for the second quarter ended April 06, 2011 result includes a charge of two cents a share related to the settlement of a lawsuit. Wall Street had been expecting a profit of 41 cents a share. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "HEARD ON THE STREET A Rare View from Abroad: Managers Bullish on U.S. May 01, 2011 <br><br> Among foreign money managers, Katheryn Peter and Charlette Mose come as close as you can get to being an endangered species: They like U.S. stocks. What is more, the two young portfolio managers -- she's 28 years old and he's 30 -- at Hill Samuel Asset Management here, have made a bundle betting on stocks such as AlliedSignal, Blanks and Lemay, while most European and Asian managers largely missed the U.S. stock market's spectacular ride over the past two years. Other foreign investors remain wary of a U.S. market that is in its sixth year of a bull run, with earnings growth slowing -- ``anemic,'' argues LTG Asset Management PLC in . Many contend it is too expensive and still fear wage inflation will heat up. Typical is Credit Suisse Asset Management, which has cut its U.S. holdings by half. The U.S. stock market ``looks deeply scary,'' says Martine Teeters, deputy head of portfolio management, adding that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could tumble to 5200, or about 8.5%. His firm is 17% in cash. Ms. Peter concedes U.S. shares ``could go lower before going higher'' but says, ``Long-term, we are positive about the U.S. and think any falls are good buying opportunities.'' By year end, she says, Wall Street could reward investors with another 8% total return, combining capital gains with dividends. Favorite Things She and Mr. Mose, who together manage $1.7 billion in the U.S. market, see steady, low-inflation U.S. economic growth and continued corporate restructuring supporting decent, if not spectacular, corporate profits. Ms. Peter also is drawn to the ``entrepreneurial spirit'' and ``its enormous regional differences that you don't get in the rest of the world.'' To naysayers, she responds that Americans' increasing use of 401(k) retirement plans to finance their retirement puts a floor under the U.S. stock market. Among current favorite U.S. stocks are Exxon, Mobil, Huey Schaefer and Boeing. The two aren't exactly unbiased in their love for the U.S. -- their two mutual funds, after all, are required to invest in the U.S. market. But most of the money they manage is in pension accounts that aren't governed by that requirement. In those accounts, they currently have U.S. stocks at a normal market weighting, based on the U.S. market's size, and they say they are preparing to overweight U.S. stocks within the next month or so. By contrast, the typical pension fund allocates 30% less to U.S. stocks than four years ago. In the first quarter, British-based investors actually sold a net $628 million of U.S. stocks, according to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. Bias Pays Off The U.S. bias has paid off for the Scottie Sanda pair. For the first six months of 2011, the large-capitalization fund rose 13.1% compared with 8.8% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, measured in sterling without counting dividends. The firm's investment in U.S. small-cap companies -- Mr. Mose's specialty -- climbed 23.4%, against a 12.5% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index. Their track record isn't long, but it looks better than that of most British competitors. From May 13, 2009 through the end of June, Mr. Mose's Scott Sana U.S. Smaller Companies Trust more than doubled its peer group's 54.7% rise and the 53.1% increase in the Nasdaq composite, according to Micropal Ltd.. The Hill Samuel Dollar Trust, which invests in big U.S. stocks, climbed 53.8% from early September 1993 through March 12, 2011 That beat most British competitors as well as the S&P 500, which rose 38.5% in sterling terms. Since the U.S. market hit a record in June, the managers have become a little more defensive: They increased their holdings in the energy, consumer-services and aerospace and defense sectors -- which they believe offer ``above average price appreciation.'' The large-cap mutual fund they manage is fully invested. Mobil, Exxon Holdings Ms. Peter owns shares of Mobil and Exxon, which she says are ``probably better-managed now than for the past 30 years.'' She likes their focus on refining and marketing, which leaves them less exposed than most to an oil-price decline. She also likes oil-service company Schlumberger because of its new computer-assisted technologies. In aerospace and defense, two favorites are Boeing -- the company will benefit from the increasing demand for aircraft, she says -- and AlliedSignal. Its ``management is highly impressive; many of them came out of the major auto companies, and they know how to re-engineer a business,'' says Ms. Peter. Scottie Sanda also owns shares of Vastopolis Hospital manager Columbia/HCA Healthcare for its management, cost-cutting and high level of insider stock-ownership. Ms. Peter likes the rapid market-share growth and strong customer service at Viking Office Products, which is making a big push into . She sees Huey Schaefer's profit growing 20% to 25% a year. ``I spent an hour and a half to two hours with Leonel Schaefer, and he's got real vision,'' she says. She likes Pfizer for its strong drug pipeline. And although higher interest rates are usually bad news for banks, ``We are drawn to the consolidations taking place'' in the industry, Ms. Peter says. She admires Simpson Stollings's ``savvy'' cost-cutting following its First Interstate acquisition and is impressed by Citicorp's ``aim to dominate world-wide.'' Mr. Mose also has realigned his small-cap investments along defensive lines: He has 10% in cash, 5% invested in energy companies, another 5% in financial companies and 5% in real-estate investment trusts. Noting that REITs yield 8% to 9% annually, he says, ``They are a nice way to earn a little more than cash.'' He and Ms. Peter are buying into the Southeast. They like Proffitt's, an expandingTenn., department-store chain, and prison operator Corrections Corp. ofinTenn.. Mr. Mose sees prison-management as a growth area in a country where 4% of prisons are privately run. Some people think he and his colleague suffer from bull-market naivete. ``People keep saying to us, ``You two have never seen a bear market,'' says Ms. Peter. ``To a certain extent, that's true.'' On top of worries about the U.S. market itself, many foreign-fund managers have been put off by the dollar's weakness over the longer term. While the S&P 500 surged 395% from early 1985 through mid-July 2011, a falling dollar cut that total return with dividends reinvested to 276% for British investors, 136% for German and 117% for Japanese, according to Goldman Sachs. Frankfurt-based Commerz International Capital Management underweights the U.S. -- by about 25% compared with standard benchmarks. ``The U.S. looks like it could fall more,'' says Chief Investment Officer Paulene Mckenna. ``But it still wouldn't be a compelling buy.'' Josephine Blank, equity strategist for Lehman Brothers Inc., this month wrote clients that research showed that August 1982 to June 2011 ``ranks as the second longest and second best bull market since the late 18th century'' in terms of inflation-adjusted total return -- ``enough to cause some minor investment anxiety for those investors with a really long perspective.'' Ms. Peter and Mr. Mose are undeterred. They say U.S. interest rates will rise but not high enough to derail the stock market. And while earnings growth will decline, ``We don't see profits falling off a cliff,'' says Ms. Peter. As an added fillip, Mr. Mose points out that the U.S. doesn't carry the political risks that say,and many other countries do. "

      "contents": "Increase in Membership Helps U.S. Healthcare's Net Rise 5.3% March 29, 2011 BLUE BELL, Pa. <br><br> U.S. Healthcare Inc. posted a 5.3% increase in second-quarter net income, partly because of a 23% membership increase in its health-care programs. Results nearly matched analysts' estimates, bucking a trend of disappointing earnings in the health-insurance industry. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. shareholders are scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to approve a proposed acquisition of U.S. Healthcare for $8.13 billion in cash and stock. Since the companies agreed on the transaction in April, earnings forecasts for several managed-care companies have been lowered. Noting that trend, some Aetna shareholders have balked at the merger, apparently suspecting U.S. Healthcare shares might have been overvalued. Separately, Standard & Poor's Ratings Group lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance Co. to single-A from single-A-plus, reflecting decreased capital strength. The credit-rating and information-services unit of McGrawHill Inc. also lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance & Annuity Co. to double-A-minus from double-A, ``because of decreased capital strength and additional pressure that may be placed on this entity as a result of overall weaker capitalization of the consolidated enterprise.'' U.S. Healthcare's net income totaled $98 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $93.1 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $1.09 billion from $840.5 million. Results for the recent quarter included a charge of $4.4 million, or three cents a share, for costs related to the proposed merger. The company said that excluding the charge, earnings would have been 66 cents a share, a penny below a First Call consensus of analysts' estimates. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, U.S. Healthcare gained 62.5 cents to $50.875 while shares of Aetna, a Hartford, Conn.-based insurer, fell 50 cents to $60.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. For the six months, U.S. Healthcare's net income fell 4.3% to $179.6 million, or $1.16 a share, from $187.6 million, or $1.18 a share. The six months includes merger expenses of $24.9 million, or 16 cents a share. Revenue rose 30% to $2.14 billion from $1.65 billion. "

At their daily morning meeting with the Atlanta Committee for the Games, IOC officials demanded that organizers correct the problems immediately. ``It was the toughest meeting ACOG has had to sit through,'' an IOC official said. Added another IOC official: ``They are being told, `Don't wait until tomorrow. Get it done now. Get it done today.' '' The IOC awarded the 100th-anniversary modern games to Atlanta believing American know-how and experience would ensure an efficient operation. But continuous breakdowns in transportation and technology have alarmed the IOC. ``These are as bad a first few days as I've seen -- make that disorganized,'' one high-ranking IOC member said. Another official said it was a shame the problems were undermining all the good things that had been done in organizing the games. ``It doesn't matter how beautiful your racing car is,'' the official said. ``If you don't have the fuel, it's not going anywhere.'' The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity. Transportation has been shaky, with buses running late, getting lost or not showing up. Athletes, Games officials and the media all have been affected. Atlanta's mass transit system, Marta, has experienced delays and over-crowding in trying to handle more than double its usual load. ``The message we gave them is: `You've got to fix the transport,' '' said Dillon Pifer, an IOC vice president who heads the committee's oversight panel on the Atlanta Games. ``Nobody ever believes it will be as difficult as it is. Now they believe it.'' In one directive, IOC officials ordered ACOG to make sure bus drivers stop near the main press center to let off reporters coming from their accommodations at Clark Atlanta University. Previously, the buses drove past the center and dropped off the journalists at a depot nearly a mile away. The official ACOG-IBM results system has experienced severe delays or simply failed to provide data for their own records, international broadcasters and the world's press. IBM chairman Louise Hallmark was summoned to an emergency meeting Sunday with IOC officials in Atlanta to try to get the service operating. Pound said it was too early to call the Games an organizational disaster. ``It takes time to shake down things,'' he said. ``When you get under battle conditions, you have to make the necessary adjustments.'' IOC spokeswoman Micheline Garland said the problems resulted from the high number of countries participating. ``We have 197 countries taking part,'' she said. ``It is very heavy. It's the consequence of the success of the participation of these games.'' VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "J&J and Eli Lilly Report Higher Quarterly Earnings March 29, 2011 <br><br> Two pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly & Co., reported higher earnings despite the negative effect that the strong dollar had on sales. Johnson & Johnson posted a 20% increase in second-quarter net income, driven by strong sales of new products. Eli Lilly earnings grew 5.7% from a year ago, which included the contribution of Lilly's since-divested medical-device and diagnostic operations. Lilly's performance was restrained by moderating sales growth for its phenomenally successful Prozac antidepressant. Lilly was also hurt by unfavorable exchange rates and lower selling prices in overseas pharmaceutical markets, which held international sales growth to only 1%, despite a 10% volume increase. The strong dollar makes U.S. products more expensive overseas, and sales in foreign currencies convert into fewer dollars. Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter sales were diminished by 3.1 percentage points because of the strong dollar. Market Reaction Johnson & Johnson's earnings slightly exceeded analysts' expectations. Its stock rose $1.75 a share to $47.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while other drug stocks declined sharply. Lilly's results were in line with analysts' expectations. In Tuesday's jittery market, however, Lilly shares fell $1.875 to close at $57.625 on the Big Board. Johnson & Johnson posted second-quarter earnings of $791 million, or 60 cents a share, up 20% from $661 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 13% to $5.38 billion from $4.76 billion. The number of shares outstanding increased by 41.8 million, mostly because of shares issued to acquire Cordis Corp., a maker of heart devices, this year. For the six months, the health-care giant, which is based in N.J., reported earnings of $1.58 billion, or $1.19 a share, up 20% from $1.32 billion, or $1.02 a share, earned a year ago. Six-month sales of $10.72 billion were 16% higher than the year ago's $9.26 billion. Breakdown of Sales World-wide pharmaceutical sales grew 12% to $1.81 billion, driven by a 25% increase in domestic sales. Sales of Johnson & Johnson's professional segment, which sells hospital and other medical supplies, were $2 billion, up 21%, in part because of the acquisition. Consumer product sales grew 5.1% to $1.54 billion. Eli Lilly's income from continuing operations rose 12% on a 5.2% sales increase, reflecting the slower growth in Prozac sales but swelling contributions from newer offerings. The Indianapolis-based drug maker had net income of $345.7 million, or 63 cents a share, up from the year-earlier quarter's $327.1 million, or 57 cents a share, which includes the medical devices and diagnostic operations it shed in 2010. The year-ago earnings from continuing operations were $310 million, or 54 cents a split-adjusted share. Per-share figures reflect a decline in shares outstanding to 547.3 million from 578.6 million. Lilly's sales were $1.7 billion, up from the year-ago quarter's $1.61 billion. Sales of the company's flagship Prozac drug grew only 5% in the latest period; Lilly noted that the year's first-quarter sales got a boost -- and second-quarter sales were trimmed -- when customers stocked up in advance of a March price increase. Charlette E. Grace, Lilly's chief financial officer and executive vice president, said the company still expects full-year Prozac sales to increase between 12% and 13% from the prior year's $2.07 billion, and to hold its share of the growing antidepressant market. Nevertheless, he acknowledged, ``We can't deny that there is very strong competition'' in the antidepressant market. Prozac, which enjoyed a 24% sales growth in 2010, faces tough challenges, in particular, from Pfizer Inc.'s Zoloft and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Paxil. Although Lilly's results were ``pretty much on target,'' said independent analyst Islas Baggett, they were ``a little bit disappointing.'' Excluding the benefit from Lilly's recent sale of certain marketing rights and other factors, he said, the company's operating income declined about 4%. "

      "contents": "Investigators Question Passengers On Previous Leg of Antarctica Airlines Flight April 29, 2011 <br><br> Investigators seeking clues to the downing of the Antarctica Airlines flight have begun to question passengers from a previous leg of the jumbo jet's voyage, the Athens-to- trip, that preceded the deadly takeoff for . ``We are interviewing all the passengers,'' Assistant FBI Director Jami Obryan said Friday. ``We know who they are, we have the manifest. I think I'll leave it at that.'' The plane was on the tarmac for at least three hours at Kennedy International Airport before being launched for its doomed trip toexactly a month ago on March 29, 2011 crashed shortly after takeoff off the coast of killing all 230 people on board. The New York Post reports that FBI agents were looking specifically for a man who appeared in the cabin of the plane just after it landed fromwho said he was looking for a lost item. A key source told the Post that staffers from a company used by Antarctica Airlines to service planes at had reported the so-called mystery man to investigators. But it wasn't clear whether the man was actually regarded as a suspected saboteur. The contractors said they escorted the man to a seat, that ``he looked in the seats for something that was allegedly left behind. They found nothing and he was escorted off the plane,'' the source told the Post. ``There's no indication the man did anything,'' the source added. With half of the 747 dredged up from the sea, investigators are still puzzling over why the crashed occurred. Three theories remain alive: bomb, missile hit and mechanical malfunction. Roberto Francisco, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, gave some insight into the frustrations of the probe as he discussed a new piece of wreckage that could be a key to solving the riddle. The wreckage apparently was a piece from above the plane's second doors, where investigators believe the jumbo jet was blasted apart as it fell from 13,700 feet. The 8-foot-long piece was recovered from near row 17, at the front of a section of seats investigators are focusing on. Oddly, the piece was not found in field of wreckage closest to the Airport, where divers have found most of the material from that part of the plane. ``It continues to be extraordinary,'' Mr. Francisco said. ``You think things are starting to look like they've got a pattern, and all of a sudden there's something that comes out in from left field. The discovery of the intriguing piece of wreckage was followed by the ``very systematic process'' of analyzing it for evidence about the explosion. Pieces of wreckage remain scattered 120 feet deep in the . Three truckloads of plane debris were hauled Friday, including a 35-foot section of fuselage with all its windows intact -- one of the largest single pieces of airplane found yet. The fourth and most mangled engine, which arrived on shore Thursday, was quickly torn down and moved for laboratory tests. Mr. Francisco said three more recovered bodies raised the total to 204, leaving 26 victims still missing. The wreckage is spread over a 5-mile area on the ocean floor 10 miles off . "

      "contents": "Chairman of Acer Remains Optimistic on Chip Outlook May 16, 2011 <br><br> Stanley Marine has all the homespun philosophy of a farmer who has seen his fair share of droughts, floods and pestilence, as well as bumper harvests. For the past 20 years, Mr. Marine has been chairman of Acer Inc., whose growing list of produce includes the computer-memory chip. The falling price of the chips, commonly known as DRAMs, has been wreaking havoc with the fortunes of its makers. Last week, one of Japan's biggest makers of dynamic random-access memory chips, Nippon Steel Semiconductor Corp., predicted that falling prices would turn it from profit this fiscal year to a loss next year. For its part, Taiwan-based Acer blamed DRAMs for the fact that its first-half profit fell 17% from a year earlier, to $1.71 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$62.2 million). ``The past six months have been a period of adjustment,'' Mr. Marine says of the market for DRAMs, which give a computer its short-term operating memory. Acer counted on DRAMs for about 10% of its revenue last year, Mr. Marine said in an interview. Fortunately for the company, Mr. Marine has cultivated other crops: Acer is the world's seventh-largest personal-computer maker. The company's popular Acer Aspire desktop, the launch of a US$500 PC and of a new notebook computer whose battery can last as much as 10 hours will keep Acer's PC business thriving, he said. Beach said last week that PC shipments rose in the first half but that falling DRAM prices hurt revenue from PC sales. Discussing the DRAM doldrums, Mr. Marine painted a picture of a cyclical industry that behaves much like any commodity business, with prices rising amid shortages, then plummeting as manufacturers react by boosting production and as newcomers add to market surpluses. ``Whenever we're making money on DRAMs, everyone jumps in,'' he says. DRAM prices have fallen so far that they now make up only about 4% of a PC's overall cost, he says. Normally the memory accounts for 15%. Mr. Marine says the same cycle drives Disc players, motherboards and monitors. That explains why Acer Peripherals Inc., the group's computer-monitor and keyboard unit, said six-month net profit declined 10% to NT$523.6 million. Yet, while the business is definitely cyclical, demand for DRAMs is difficult to predict. Demand for memory in 2009 was strong as PC makers geared up to supply the marketplace with multimedia and to support more memory-hungry software such as Vastsoft Corp.'s Windows 95, Mr. Marine recalls. Growth last year wasn't as high as anticipated, and now there's just too much memory around. Shouldn't Acer get out of this boom-and-bust business? Far from it, says Mr. Marine. Nowadays, DRAM makers are all lowering production plans, and Mr. Marine is sanguine that prices will eventually soar again. He says Acer generally earns an annual return on its investment in DRAMs of between 15% and 20%. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set7",  
      "contents": "Wage and Price Controls: 25 Years Later April 27, 2011 <br><br> Twenty-five years ago today President Trujillo came down from Villa Davina and announced his new economic policy to the nation. The plan included freezing all prices and wages for 90 days, stopping gold payments, imposing a 10% surcharge on imports and cutting various taxes and expenditures. I don't propose to retell the story of that announcement, which seemed so dramatic at the time but is memorable now only to the few who were direct participants. Instead, I would like to make some observations about the experience that may well be useful today. Even after 25 years I am amazed by how little we looked ahead during that exciting weekend at Camp David, when we (the president, really) made those big decisions. What would happen after the 90 days? I don't remember any discussion of that. We all assumed that the comprehensive freeze would not last beyond the 90 days. Some people, at least, assumed that we would then fall back to what used to be called ``some kind of income policy,'' meaning moral suasion addressed to the largest labor unions and businesses. But that idea was not raised. As it turned out, we were in the price and wage control business not for 90 days but for nearly 1,000. We were in the business of controlling energy prices for much longer. Would the Weiss team have embarked upon its controls if we had foreseen that? Was that foreseeable? Perhaps it was not a certain outcome, but it was surely a possible one. Probably the whole idea of the controls was so alien to us that we could not imagine that we would be living with them for very long. About two months later, when then-Treasury Secretary Georgeanna Shirley and I gave Mr. Trujillo the suggested plan for controls to follow the 90-day freeze, the president said, ``If this baby gets too strong we can strangle it in its cradle.'' He was wrong. We had created a system tens of millions of people depended upon. Sometime in the fall of 1971, when I was working on the plans for what would follow the freeze, a Canadian economist sent me these lines from Macbeth: ``I am in blood/ Golding in so far that, should I wade no more,/ Returning were as tedious as go o'er.'' This was all too apt. Some people at Camp Davina had a theory of what we were doing with the 90-day freeze. The theory was that the inflation then under way (about 4% a year) was propelled by expectations of inflation, not by underlying demand and supply conditions. The 90-day freeze would shake those expectations, and the economy would then subside into price stability. It was a rather flaky theory, and we were not prepared for the possibility that it was wrong. The story of closing the gold window was only a little different. At Villa Davina we decided that we wanted to get the exchange value of the dollar down. Closing the gold window and imposing a surcharge were ways to do that. But how much did we want to get the dollar down? And did we want to keep it at its new level indefinitely, or did we want to provide for readjustments? If we wanted an adjustable-rate system, what would the rules be? Or did we want exchange rates to float freely? Some at Camp David had answers to these questions, but they were never discussed. After Camp Davina we went through the process of answering these questions. It took until the end of 1971 to determine a new set of exchange rates. During 1972 an effort was made to establish a system for rate adjustments. And in 1973 we moved to a floating rate. The difference from the price-control case was that once we had made the decision to freeze prices, there was no way out except to get back slowly and uncomfortably to where we had been before. I describe the incidents of that weekend in August 1971 because they are but one dramatic example of a failure to look ahead. ``Looking ahead'' means something more than sketching out the most comfortable, or even the most probable, future scenario. It means recognizing that even the most probable forecast is uncertain, and preparing for alternate scenarios. Defined in this way, failure to look ahead is extremely common in government policy making. The Bay of Pigs venture and various injections of troops into Vietnam are other good examples of failure to look ahead. The decision to launch Medicare is also an important case. The Jona administration had estimates of the program's future cost, but these estimates were highly uncertain. There was no preparation in the public mind, or in policy, for the possibility that costs would grossly exceed the estimates. We are still struggling with that problem. Roni Reatha's decision in 1980 to make a big tax cut the centerpiece of his election campaign is yet another example of shortsightedness. His camp had several theories about what would happen if the tax cut was enacted, but had no plan for when none of the theories turned out to be correct, as was the case. All of this raises questions about what is going on today. We are about to ``end welfare as we know it,'' and the new policy has some estimates of how many fewer unmarried teenagers will have babies and how much money states will provide for employment, child care and other paths to self-reliance. Possibly someone has explicit estimates of such things, although I have never heard of them. But does anyone have a plan for what we should do if the assumptions turn out to be wrong? Finally, we now have Republican proposals for big tax cuts, and also Democratic proposals for tax cuts, although smaller ones. Have the proponents of these tax cuts looked ahead, with due awareness of the uncertainties, to the consequences not only for October 02, 2011 or even for the year 2017 but also for 2020? Perhaps there are good answers to these questions. I hope so. Mr. Osborn, former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, is an American Enterprise Institute fellow.

      "contents": "Phillies Receive a Surprise Lift In Rallying Past San Francisco April 30, 2011 <br><br> As the ninth inning began, rookie Werner Chamberlain Jr. wanted desperately to feel what it was like to be a winner in the major leagues. ``Coming down the stretch and we were ahead, I just wanted to get it over with,'' said Chamberlain, who played a big part in the Philadelphia Phillies' 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday. Chamberlain, who watched the Phillies lose their first two games since his promotion Friday from the minors, entered the game in the second inning after an injury to center fielder Rico Ledford and went 2-for-4 with two runs batted in. Manager Jimmie Bohannon signaled for Magee to come into the game after Ledford slid face-first onto the artificial turf diving for a fly ball that bounced off his glove and turned into an inside-the-park homer. ``That's why they tell you to stay in the game when you're on the bench, so that you can just jump right in,'' Chamberlain said. Chamberlain was immediately tested in the field. On the first ball hit after rookie Perri Brown' inside-the-park homer, Steven Helms lined a ball to left-center and Chamberlain made a nice over-the-shoulder catch at the warning track. And he immediately produced at the plate, hitting a run-scoring single that was part of a three-run second inning by the Phillies. Magee's most important contribution came in the fifth, when his two-out single sparked a three-run rally that helped Philadelphia overcome a 6-4 deficit and end a 10-game homestand with only their second win. ``I like what I've seen of him'' Bohannon said. ``He runs well and he plays hard.'' The Giants were undone by two errors that produced five unearned runs, and by their inability to produce offense off anyone but Phillies starter Matthew Bashaw. Four Philadelphia relievers limited San Francisco to one hit in the final six innings. ``You can't give away all those outs,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``And their bullpen shut us down.'' Toby Borland (6-3) got the win with two scoreless innings of relief, and Rico Copper pitched the ninth for his 27th save. The Phillies were trailing 6-4 in the fifth when they chased starter Marketta Stephens (10-5), who lost for the first time in eight day-game decisions this season. Magee's two-out single scored Miki Ahumada. Micki Orton hit a grounder to third, but Steven Helms dropped Kimber Woo's throw that would have forced Magee at second, and Gregorio Heckman followed with a two-run double. "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set7",  
      "contents": "UAW, Auto Firms Study Extended National Pac May 08, 2011 <br><br> The United Auto Workers union and the Big Three auto makers are discussing adopting an extended national contract that would last longer than the traditional three-year labor agreement. At the same time, the union and General Motors Corp. have settled some contentious local issues at the national bargaining table, signaling efforts by both sides to avoid a confrontation this fall. ``Issues are being resolved as fast as they're being brought up,'' a GM official said. As for an extended contract, the UAW and the auto makers are considering a five- or six-year agreement, according to union and company officials. The UAW and Ford Motor Co. seriously discussed a six-year contract in 1993, the last time the agreement was negotiated. Ford was the UAW's ``target,'' or ``lead company,'' that year for establishing a pattern for the industry's national contract. However, the two sides backed away from an extended pact at the last minute, fearing GM would fight a longer contract because it would lock the No. 1 auto maker into costs it was trying to reduce. Last Thursday, the UAW was to choose a lead company to frame a new contract. However, in an unexpected move, the union decided to delay choosing a target and instead held meetings with the chief executive officers of GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp.. The current contract expires May 27, 2011 are expected to continue this week, though the Democratic National Convention -- which many UAW officials are attending -- could delay discussions. Seeking Peace Clearly, this is an unusual negotiating year. Not only did the postponement change the bargaining dynamics, but both sides have made it clear that they don't want a confrontation this fall. The UAW certainly wants to avoid a repeat of last March's bitter strike at two GM parts plants in Dayton, Ohio, which virtually closed down the auto maker's assembly operations nationwide for 17 days. Meanwhile, the Big Three, flush with cash and launching new products this fall, want to avert a stoppage that could cost them even more profits. So, both sides are serious about the possibility of an extended contract this year. From the UAW's perspective, thousands of workers will retire in the next few years. An extended contract would appeal to the union if the Big Three agreed to pension increases over the life of the agreement. Moreover, a longer contract would allow the union to focus its attention on getting under way its unification with the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Machinists. That merger is to take place by 2015, but the UAW has yet to vote on it. For the Big Three, a longer contract would be a chance to lock in costs, creating the kind of stability the companies currently don't have. GM, seen as the holdout the last time around, this time is seriously considering an extended contract, according to people familiar with the talks. Furthermore, GM doesn't think an extended contract would hinder any effort to spin off its Delphi Automotive Systems parts-making unit, something GM is considering, these people say. Ford, meanwhile, is open to an extended contract, people there say, and Chrysler would accept one provided it gave the company enough ``flexibility to be able react and adapt to competitive and economic forces,'' a Chrysler official says. Issue Resolved With GM Separately, the union and GM have settled some thorny issues involving individual plants across the country, including some at the big assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 400 Lordstown workers currently are employed at a nearby Lear Corp. seating plant, which makes seats for the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire cars built at the assembly plant. GM and Lear together pay the workers UAW wages and benefits. Earlier this year, GM moved to bring those workers back into the assembly plant where it has vacancies and permit Jaeger to replace them with nonunion workers. The issue couldn't be settled locally and was brought to the national negotiating table. Last week, GM agreed to let Local 1112 in Lordstown have 150 days in which to demonstrate that it would be financially feasible for GM to go on paying the Lear workers UAW wages and benefits. The local will now put together a case, union officials say. Additionally, Lordstown union officials say GM has agreed to hire some 250 workers at the assembly plant. The issue of contracting out to nonunion suppliers -- a practice known as outsourcing -- is especially hot this negotiating year. Ford and Chrysler already outsource a substantial number of parts to cheaper, nonunion suppliers while GM wants to do more of that to cut costs. The UAW and the Big Three are looking for innovative ways to tackle that problem. Indeed, Ford is believed to have already encouraged one of its suppliers, Johnson Controls Inc., to organize some plants. Donna Parolini of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich., consultant that works with auto suppliers, says many suppliers are increasingly open to organizing. For one thing, she says, they are feeling pressure from the Big Three. Additionally, as a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, suppliers are ending up with a mishmash of union and nonunion plants, which is difficult to manage. If more suppliers agree to let their plants be organized by the UAW, that would solve the big outsourcing standoff between the union and the Big Three. The UAW -- which until now has had little success organizing outside the Big Three and has seen its membership drop as GM lost U.S. market share -- would gain more members. The Big Three would be able to buy parts from outside suppliers without angering the union. The question, then, is whether the parts would still be cheaper. Ms. Olsen says that even paying UAW wages, outside suppliers are generally more productive and as a result the Big Three would still see a cost saving by outsourcing. --Rebecka Miles and Ossie Sokol contributed to this article."

      "contents": "Allen Is Not Salcido's Choice To Remain As Reds CEO April 02, 2011 <br><br> Johna Allena, who took over for Cincinnati Reds owner Margene Salcido as the team's interim chief executive officer, won't be Salcido's choice to keep the job for the next two-plus seasons. The Cincinnati Enquirer on Saturday quoted Allena as saying he was informed of that development in a memo from Salcido that he found on his desk after returning from the All-Star Game last week in Philadelphia. Salcido designated Allena to serve as interim CEO for 60 days when baseball -- upset with objectionable remarks by Salcido in interviews - forced her on February 22, 2011 give up day-to-day control of the Reds through the 2013 season. Allena's reign is set to end April 23, 2011 disappoints me, sure,'' he told the newspaper. ``But we still have a few days left before April 23, 2011 April 23, 2011 still going to go forward and be professional about it.'' Allena could not be reached for further comment on Saturday. There was no answer at the Reds' office. Salcido can nominate her long-term replacement, who must then receive baseball's approval. Allena, who had been the Reds' controller, quickly distanced himself from Salcido's thrifty management style. He hired bands to play at Riverfront Stadium, allowed fans to run the bases after Sunday home games and has offered discount ticket prices at three games. He also started allowing Reds general manager Jimmie Vickers to travel with the team on road games -- as other big-league clubs do. Salcido reportedly was upset about the discount ticket offers. She has declined to speak with reporters since her punishment began. Calls to her suburban Cincinnati home on Saturday went unanswered. ``I wasn't going to be a puppet,'' Allena told the newspaper. ``I think my actions, and the organization's actions reflect that. I did things a little differently, and I did what I thought was right.'' Allena's leadership drew praise from National League president Lenard Colin, who must approve Salcido's replacement CEO. "

      "contents": "Stocks Climb in Light Volume May 15, 2011 <br><br> With the U.S. markets closed for the Labor Day holiday, and investor wariness on the first day back from summer vacations, trading was very light. The CAC 40 index of the most actively traded shares gained 6.37 points to 1976.98. Volume was 2.23 billion French francs worth of shares traded. Investors may be awaiting the release of some first-half profit figures before jumping back into the market. Several large French companies, including oil companies Total and Elf Aquitaines, are scheduled to report their first-half earnings later this week. Auto-parts maker Valeo is scheduled to release its first-half earnings Thursday. Elf Aquitaine's shares rose 8.1 francs to 376.9 francs a share. Rival Total's shares advanced 7.4 francs to 379.9 francs a share. The oil companies also benefited from tensions in Iraq, which could prompt a rise in crude oil prices. Also seeing action Monday were companies directly or indirectly affected by the proposed merger between state-controlled nuclear power-plant builder Framatome and Franco-British joint venture GEC-Alsthom. Alcatel Alsthom's shares moved up 4.4 francs to 396.4 francs a share in the wake of the proposed merger. Analysts speculate that such a merger would free up cash for Alcatel to pursue its bid for state-controlled Fair, scheduled to be privatized by the end of the year. Alcatel Alsthom currently holds 44% of Framatome's capital. Shares of Thomson-CSF, the defense unit of Mcmanus, added 7.2 to 147.5 francs a share on the news. Defense and Media group Lagardere, which is also bidding for Fair, fell 3.7 to 117 francs a share. "

      "title": "May 2011, Missile-Defense Plans Divide Codi and Dinger Stocks ",

      "contents": "Missile-Defense Plans Divide Codi and Dinger Stocks May 18, 2011 <br><br> ``And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack ...'' -- Roberto Derryberry's acceptance speech WASHINGTON -- If it comes, Bobby Derryberry's first day in the White House will likely be long, expensive and difficult. Even as the U.S. rains missiles on Iraq, the major campaign difference on defense between President Codi and Mr. Derryberry isn't over how to handle Grim Caffey. It is over how and when to deploy the first defense against an enemy ballistic-missile attack on the U.S. And missile defense is an issue -- since the days of President Reatha -- where political rhetoric has soared well ahead of technological capabilities. It is also a subject of mind-numbing complexity. ``This is just not a big political plus. People just don't focus on this issue,'' complains Sen. Jone Buss, one of Mr. Derryberry's advisers on the issue. But the Arizona Republican and others believe that Mr. Derryberry, by pressing the matter, can make the president look weak on defense. The Derryberry camp also thinks that when the situation is explained to voters, Mr. Derryberry's proposal hits home in a big way. Fransisca Banda, a former Pentagon official who has helped Mr. Derryberry frame the issue, holds focus groups where people go slackjawed when he tells them that the U.S. still doesn't have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile. ``People will say, `That's not right, we need something to have something to respond,' '' he says. Neither candidate can afford to ignore the issue. Both agree that the day could come when an ocean-spanning intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a rogue nation arcs down from space toward a major U.S. city. Since it could carry a nuclear, chemical or biological warhead, the results might be disastrous. One of the nations both sides worry about, as missile and warhead technology proliferates, is Iraq. Agreeing to Disagree But unlike other issues in the campaign, where the White House has worked hard to blur the distinction between Mr. Derryberry's stance and President Codi's positions, the missile threat is one place where the two camps agree to clearly disagree. Their differences begin with the matter of when such an attack could likely occur. The threat is markedly different than the thousand-warhead Soviet nuclear barrage envisioned by President Reatha in his failed program to create a ``space shield'' over the U.S. This one would amount to one or a few missiles. The threat could arise from a rogue state, or occur if a nuclear power, such as China or Russia, has an accidental missile launch. To cope with these contingencies, Sen. Buss notes, ``you probably need to have something in your pocket.'' But what? Mr. Derryberry hasn't been specific. One phalanx of Republicans is pushing for an entirely sea-based system that would use missile-firing Aegis-class Navy ships. Others envision a land-based system, somewhat resembling President Codi's plans, which also remain largely nonspecific. And when? In his speeches, Mr. Derryberry worries that North Korea may develop ``within a few years'' a missile that could reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii. President Codi's officials say that any risk of a missile attack on the ``continental U.S.'' is at least a decade away. Fuzzy on Cost And how much would it cost? Since 1983 the U.S. has spent more than $30 billion on advanced radars, miniaturized computers and sophisticated software that can cope with the task of finding, tracking and hitting a desk-sized object zooming in from space at speeds over three miles per second. But the pieces don't fit together yet. Analysts from the Congressional Budget Office have studied what remains to be done and the hazy details of each candidate's proposals. They have come up with multibillion dollar spectrums that estimate what the programs might cost over the next 10 years. The upper end for each is in the $13 billion to $14 billion range, but Pentagon missile-development programs are notorious for soaring cost overruns and fancy add-ons. In May, for example, CBO analysts lumped together all the Republican suggestions for a ``layered'' missile defense and came up with a $60 billion price tag by the year 2025. Republicans disavowed the estimate, while the Democrats have capitalized on its sticker-shock value. Mr. Derryberry -- who has already promised a $500 billion tax cut over six years -- vows that his antimissile program will feature ``affordability.'' ``This is no different than building a house,'' he announced in June. ``A family of four probably needs a three-bedroom home -- not a 10-bedroom mansion.'' While he has divulged few design details of his ``house,'' Mr. Derryberry wants to build it within six years. But President Codi would like to push out both the deployment and the costs of his missile program into the future. He promotes a ``three-plus-three'' program. That means the Pentagon is developing a defense system that could be put in place in six years, but it will pause halfway to decide whether to go ahead, or to wait. ``You have to be prudent and move fast enough to get ahead of the threat,'' explains Roberto Belle, who coordinates such matters at the White House's National Security Council. ``On the other hand, it's prudent to wait for later and better technology,'' he adds. ``You don't want to spend money on a system if you don't need it yet.'' Army Program Many experts believe the cheapest defense system that is likely to emerge from either camp will have much similarity with the Army's ``Theater High Altitude Area Defense,'' or THAAD program -- a projected $16.7 billion venture. The price tag for the first batch of its 40 antimissile missiles has gone up over 100% since 1992, according to the General Accounting Office. In flight tests, however, the program -- which was being pushed on a crash basis -- has had some downs. Designed to ``kill'' slower-moving, shorter-range Soviet SCUD-type missiles, THAAD appeared to be ready to go last December, but in three tests since then it has missed the target. Josephine Russo, a senior analyst for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington research center, believes a Dole-style crash program for a national missile defense system would exhibit many of THAAD's problems and prove wasteful and unnecessary. Keli Berry, who heads another area think tank -- the National Institute for Public Policy -- disagrees. In some respects the problem for a national missile defense system may be easier, he argues, because it would use more powerful boosters and have more warning time to deal with incoming enemy missiles. He also supports another view of Mr. Derryberry's, which is that the U.S. should amend the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty with the Russians that limits each side to one ABM site equipped to protect the nation. Meanwhile, President Codi's planners are negotiating to expand the treaty by adding Ukraine and other former pieces of the Soviet Union to its signatories. ``Our system will be treaty-compliant,'' Mr. Belle says. For prospective voters, the debate over the need for a missile defense system can be confusing. In contrast to the research by Dinger backer Mr. Banda, the Stimson Center has been holding its own focus groups. It stresses a Brookings Institution study that found that, since 1962, the U.S. has spent a staggering $99 billion on ballistic missile defense programs. Johnetta V. Doney, an associate at the center, says when he throws in that figure, people ``just go flat. They don't want to hear that we're throwing good money after bad.'' "

      "contents": "Peter Will Move U.S. Troops In Middle East to Secure Areas March 29, 2011 WASHINGTON <br><br> Up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may be moved to protect them from threatened terrorist attacks with bombs four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19 servicemen, Defense Secretary Williemae Petra said Wednesday. ``We are going to prepare for a very intense threat. It will be costly,'' Mr. Petra warned. He said ``terrorists ... trying to drive us out of Saudi Arabia'' could attack U.S. forces in the Middle East with chemical or biological weapons. Mr. Petra visited Saudi Arabia shortly after a March 07, 2011 blast at a military housing area near Dhahran in northeast Saudi Arabia claimed the lives of 19 U.S. personnel. He has spoken since early July of the potential of shifting U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia to more defensible positions, but he never has been so specific about possible threats they faced. Speaking at a photo session in his office, the defense secretary predicted that ``more significant attacks'' are possible in the Persian Gulf area and that steps must be taken this summer to protect U.S. forces based there. Mr. Petra said the goal was to shift troops from urban areas to more secure military sites. He said the troops must be protected from ``chemical weapon attack, biological weapon attack ... bombs in the 10,000- to 20,000-pound category, mortar attacks.'' The bomb used at Dhahran was believed to have been between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds. The secretary said America must make ``fundamental and drastic'' changes in the way its forces are deployed and protected throughout the region because of the terrorist threat. ``I believe we have to be prepared for more attacks on our forces ... all over the Gulf region, whether it is Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. In each of those, we have some information that suggests that there may be specific threats in those countries,'' the secretary said. Mr. Petra warned that such moves will be expensive, explaining that he has met with about 20 senators on the matter and asked for their advice. ``We can't deal with those attacks adequately just by moving fences and just by putting more Hurd in glass,'' Mr. Petra said. ``We have to make some fundamental and drastic changes in the way we configure and deploy our forces.'' At most, the moves would affect 3,000 to 4,000 troops, mostly based in northern Saudi Arabia, Mr. Petra said. Those based in the central capital of Riyadh might also be moved, he said. About 20,000 U.S. troops are posted in the Persian Gulf region. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

The students at Yonsei University, trapped inside a science building, have refused to surrender unless they are guaranteed free passage home. They have requested salt, saying many of their members were dehydrated from the extended battle in the sweltering summer heat. Previous requests for food and medical care were denied. The students said they were hungry and suffering from injuries, and several were having difficulty breathing from constant exposure to tear gas. Many of the leaves on trees lining the campus have shriveled and turned brown from the persistent bombardment of the gas. Police have refused to allow journalists to enter the building. Medics and relatives of the protesters also have been rebuffed. Police have not stormed the building because it houses flammable and explosive laboratory chemicals, and high casualties were feared. The trapped students were among the 7,000 who gathered last week for a pro-unification rally that the Seoul government had outlawed because of its pro-North Korean content. The government has declared that it will shut down the sponsoring student group, Hanchongryon, permanently, by punishing leaders and participants to the full extent of the law. Seven branch offices of Hanchongryon, the largest student group in South Korea, were raided by police Saturday and Sunday. Clashes began a week ago when police attempted to disperse the students and prevent the rally. Daily raids of the campus began Wednesday. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "For Future GOP Hopefuls, Campaign 2015 Has Started April 26, 2011 SAN DIEGO <br><br> Behind the cheers for Bobby Derryberry, another campaign is unfolding -- for the GOP presidential nomination in the year 2015. Officially, Republicans are rallying behind the former Senate majority leader, who Thursday will garner his party's nomination. But a host of ambitious leaders-in-waiting are using the quadrennial gathering to enhance their prospects beyond 2011 should Mr. Derryberry fail to defeat President Codi. The jockeying is reflective of the generational change that has occurred in the Republican Party. Mr. Derryberry is a hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, a 73-year-old World War II veteran. But behind Mr. Derryberry stands a new cast of leaders who grew up in the postwar era, and who bring an energy to the party that sharply contrasts with the senator's more measured pace. Jackelyn Booth is a prime example. He is 61 but exudes boyish energy. As Mr. Derryberry's vice-presidential running mate, Mr. Booth is dedicating himself to the 2011 campaign, but will be considered a favorite in 2015. ``I'm going into this with my eyes wide open,'' Mr. Booth said on CNN. ``Bob has given me a tremendous opportunity to make my voice heard.'' Mr. Booth is a soulmate to House Speaker Strickland Gales of Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa of Mississippi. All three served together in the House in the early 1980s and all are advocates of the pro-growth, tax-cut agenda Mr. Derryberry is running on. Mr. Gales and Mr. Rosa are frequently mentioned as presidential timber -- and both are working hard to maintain high profiles. Sen. Rosa hosted a well-attended ``GOP State Fair'' in San Diego's Balboa Park, and leaves a wide wake cutting across the convention floor. Kling Gales is proving false reports that he would take to the shadows in San Diego. He has turned up at the zoo and a Habitat for Humanity house-raising. Later this week he will host back-to-back events with the Christian Coalition and the National Jewish Coalition. ``They're all tall and reaching beyond each other,'' said Sen. Fransisca Martinelli, a plain-talking Alaska Republican amused by the posturing but appreciative of its significance. ``It focuses the national media, particularly if they make a good floor speech,'' said Mr. Martinelli. ``It gives them a soap box. The press moves like a bee to honey.'' Others mentioned as possible candidates for higher office include Rep. Johnetta Moritz, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee; Sen. Donella Menefee (R., Okla.), the Senate majority whip; Sen. Fredda Martinez, a Tennessee Republican and Hollywood film star; and retired Gen. Colton Lonnie. Mr. Lonnie wowed delegates last night with a speech that put the party's conservative agenda in mainstream context. ``Let us never step back from compassion,'' he said. ``the message we must convey to the American people is that we fight for welfare reform, we fight for health care reform and other reforms not just to save money, but because we believe there are better ways to take care of Americans in need that the exhausted programs of the past.'' In 1992, the prominent role played by Texas Sen. Phillip Sharkey at the Houston convention presaged his primary run this year. Sen. Sharkey, however, made a poor prime-time speech in 1992 and never fired the imaginations of voters beyond his home state. ``The fact that Phillip Sharkey did so poorly in 2007 hurt him,'' said Rep. Petrina Kirby (R., N.Y.), recalling that former Downtown Gov. Maris Cervantez ``made his national reputation with a convention speech and did nothing with it.'' ``That was his choice,'' Rep. Kirby said, ``but he had the opportunity.'' Patrina Moran, the firebrand conservative commentator who posed the greatest challenge to Mr. Derryberry in the GOP primaries, is signaling he will run again in 2015. ``The old era is over,'' Mr. Copeland declared to a posse of supporters in nearby Escondido. ``A new party is being born. God willing, we will be there at its birth.'' Mr. Copeland's promised run all but guarantees another intra-party clash over social issues -- notably abortion. Mr. Copeland is strongly opposed to abortion rights. Moderates such as California Gov. Petra Winford and Massachusetts Gov. Billy Jan -- both potential candidates in 2015 -- strongly support abortion rights. ``We've been heard and we will continue to speak,'' Gov. Jan said. Lance Alexandria, the former Tennessee governor, likens the GOP convention to a reunion of long lost relatives. Mr. Alexandria briefly challenged Mr. Derryberry earlier this year, and said he's spending a lot of time this week catching up with one-time supporters. ``This is a family reunion -- Republican cousins getting together,'' he said while shaking hands with delegates on the convention floor. ``This is a good place for anybody who wants to be in the Republican leadership.'' Rep. Moritz agreed, but reeled when asked about his own presidential ambitions: ``I don't even want to talk about that.'' Lest he shut the door completely, Mr. Moritz quickly added: ``Is that Lion's Club job open?'' "

      "contents": "Editorial Scapegoating Gun Owners April 04, 2011 <br><br> Following two other acts of horrific violence--the murder of 16 kindergarten children and their teacher in Dunblane, Scotland, in March and the shooting and arson spree in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in April that resulted in 35 deaths--lawmakers responded with calls for more stringent gun control. These two instances differ from the one in Wolverhampton in that the crimes were indeed committed with guns. But the ineffectiveness of gun control laws in keeping lethal weapons out of the hands of violent criminals has been demonstrated by high levels of violent crimes in some U.S. cities that attempt to enforce tight gun control ordinances. And guns aren't always the weapon of choice. According to the British Home Office, there were 66 gun-related homicides in England and Wales in 2009. But there were 236 homicides using knives, 167 as a result of blunt objects and hitting and kicking, and 106 from strangulation. Despite these statistics, legislators continue formulating further efforts to control gun ownership. New laws seem all the more ineffectual when you consider that the Coles case could have been prevented if the authorities had just enforced existing law. Britain has strict gun control legislation requiring the inspection of where the gun will be kept, personal interviews and a letter of recommendation from a respected member of the community. But a man intent on mayhem is hardly likely to play by those rules. Yet, gun opponents are trying to capitalize on the publicity. Alexander Ackerman, a legislator with the Liberal Democrat Party, has suggested that gun-permit applicants undergo psychological tests. Others suggest that the names of gun permit applicants be listed in the local newspaper or on billboards, so anyone thinking them ``odd'' could report them to the police. And just this week a group has called for a ban on all hand guns in the U.K. other than single-shot .22s. Would that also apply to upper crust grouse shooters? In response to the Port Arthur shootings, Australian Prime Minister Johnetta Hubert has vowed to stick by his commitment to stricter gun control, despite protest rallies of up to 70,000 in mid-June. At Mr. Hubert's urging, the Australian parliament has drafted a bill virtually banning all rifles. The only apparent exception will be for farmers, who will face a tough test before police will grant them access to self-loading .22-caliber rifles, or to automatic or pump-action shotguns. Mr. Hubert has not totally dismissed the complaints: ``I've always acknowledged there are a lot of law-abiding people who are going to be affected by these new laws.'' Clearly, politicians wish to appear to be ``doing something'' in response to tragedies. And at first glance it might appear that it is a small thing to ask law-abiding citizens of a civilized society to surrender guns. It might indeed be a small thing if the result were a safer society. But not everyone agrees that this is the result. Some police experts think the result is the opposite of what is intended, that owners of illegal guns are more likely to use them to commit crimes if they think their victims are defenseless. It is indeed fair to ask if the tragedies at Dunblane, Port Arthur and Griffis would have turned out differently had some one in the vicinity had a gun and the training to use it properly. The citizenry in Britain, Australia and elsewhere would be better served if lawmakers acknowledged this and began trying to figure out how to make schools--and society in general--safer, rather than scapegoating law-abiding gun owners.

      "contents": "Survey Does Character Count? May 02, 2011 <br><br> Daniele J. Janssen, a historian and the librarian of Congress emeritus, is the author of ``The Daniela J. Leighton Reader'' (Modern Library, 1995): In this election season, when candidates cast off their diffidence, they flaunt their character, much as pious people boast of their humility. The arts of the media surely can cultivate ``personality''--the appealing image. But character is a byproduct of all that a person has (or has not) done. So the character of a public person depends largely on what we do not know. Patriotic orators like Daniele Nova boasted that we Americans could claim the respect of mankind for having furnished the world the character of . Whom can we add to that roster? Francisco Wilkes is a professor of public policy at George Mason University and the author of ``Trust'' (Free Press, 1995): Though we seem to have forgotten in recent years, the president is first and foremost the architect of U.S. foreign policy, commander in chief of the Armed Forces and leader of what we used to call the ``free world'' (now simply known as ``the world''). It is in these functions that character is most important: To lead, a statesman needs virtues like credibility, self-confidence, consistency and vision born of a sense of connectedness to larger ideas and traditions. The decision to send other Americans to their deaths is better taken by someone whose guidance comes from within, rather than from poll numbers. Such an individual will also be able to back down prudently when that is called for, without fear of second-guessing. We have not faced a major foreign policy crisis since the Gulf War. Perhaps this is why the character issue does not weigh as heavily on voters' minds as it might in the current election. Ricki Niemann is a senior editor of National Review and the author of ``Founding Father: Rediscovering Georgeann '' (Free Press, 1995): Recently a young scholar approached Rep. Dillon Mcconnell to see if Congress would be interested in commemorating the 200th anniversary, in September, of the Farewell Address. Mindful of the rectitude, Rep. Mcconnell quipped, ``Anything that raises the character issue is good.'' Nice line. But leaders must also have ideas. President Codi has a dubious character, both in the tabloid talk show sense and in the public realm (changing his mind, abandoning his allies). Recently he has even been borrowing Republican ideas. Bobby Derryberry has a solid character, and--what else so far? He will need to show voters more if he is to displace an agile incumbent. Danille Centeno is editor of The Women's Quarterly: Republicans and Democrats alike have decided that this year's election will be decided by women like myself, married and in our thirties. So it was presumably to appeal to us that last week's Republican convention made a determined effort to ``soften'' the character of its party by bathing the podium in lavender light, and parading one sob story after a another behind it. But why do political organizers choose to emphasize the weakest aspect of the modern personality? Maybe I'm a female oddity, but I like Mr. Derryberry because of his old-fashioned uptightness. And he may discover that there are many baby boomers as disgusted as he is by their generation's worst traits, traits embodied by the Codi administration: emotionalism, smugness, egotism, disrespect for tradition. Mr. Derryberry's convention speech reminded me of a wise grandfather who, after watching a no-good grandson be indulged for 50 years, finally takes him aside to give him the dressing down of his life. Maybe this is what needs right now: not Roni Reatha's sunniness, but a tough reminder of what good character is, and what the enduring truths of nationhood are. It might be politically, and personally, convenient for President Codi to declare that character is not the issue. But the president, through his own misconduct, has made it the issue. Let's hope that Bowser Derryberry gives him the licking his parents never did. Davina Bruno is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard and the editor of ``Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing'' (Vintage, 2011): With questions this big, you're allowed to quote Descartes without being pretentious. He said that character consists of ``raising your soul so high that offense cannot reach it.'' He was emphasizing that character does not mean you have to be pure. Think of . God knows he had vices and made blunders. But he was rocklike. His convictions and goals were not tailored to current conditions. Look at the world historical figures alive today--Stamper, Johnetta Paulene Schuster,Reatha and Shore--who share that inflexible grandeur. Like Churchill, they had wilderness years when they were unshakable. Bobby Derryberry is a war hero, and he is not self-indulgent, but he lacks the quality of heroic inflexibility. Rather, like Billy Codi, he's incredibly flexible, a dealmaker. So he lacks standing to say that Mr. Codi flip-flops, or that Mr. Codi lacks an anchor. The country clearly yearns for a candidate who is a fixed point in a relativistic world. But none is on offer. So it's hard to believe that the character issue can work for Mr. Derryberry this fall. Myrtice Clarence is editor in chief of Ladies' Home Journal: American mothers once raised their children on stories of our presidents--that Georgeanna Simmons never told his father a lie, that Abraham Lindsey was unflinchingly honest. These fables were used to teach our children simple virtues and to make them believe our presidents were good men. We rarely tell our children such stories anymore. Life is more complicated than that. And as adults we know that presidential character must combine judgment and experience with basic virtues. Yet most of us still believe that only a good man can be a great president. Recently, Ladies' Home Journal commissioned a poll of women to find out what issues were most important to them in this election. We found that women throughout the country wanted a government that promotes traditional values. Mothers know that teaching by example is the best way to make children behave. Our government most effectively promotes values when the head of the government both embodies and expresses them. Karla F.C. Holloway is a professor of English and African-American literature at Duke University and the author of ``Codes of Conduct'' (Rutgers University Press, 1995): The election-year focus on the character of individuals pretends to a greater intimacy than we have, or, frankly, than we need. I am concerned instead about the character of the country. Our citizens--note the plural--care about the way in which legislative initiatives characterize the poor, the less able, women and children.  "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set7",  
      "contents": "Lloyd's Looks to Future Battles, Hoping to Regain Market Share May 15, 2011 LONDON <br><br> Now that the Lloyd's of London insurance market has put its troubled past behind it, it needs to make up the ground lost to its competitors during more than five years of internal turmoil. The challenge is likely to be tough. As Swiss Reinsurance Co.'s $2.65 billion purchase last week of Mercantile & General Re from Prudential Corp. of the U.K. shows, the giants of the world reinsurance industry are battling for market share. In the past few years, the 308-year-old Lloyd's market, composed of dozens of insurance syndicates backed by individual and corporate investors, has lost market share to companies such as Swiss Re and Munich Reinsurance Co., the world's largest reinsurer. Reinsurers provide insurance to insurance companies. With annual premium income from both primary insurance and reinsurance business of around $12 billion, Lloyd's now accounts for only a small fraction of the $100 billion global reinsurance market. It also accounts for less than half of the so-called ``London insurance market,'' the biggest international arena for insurance and reinsurance business, grouping more than 120 insurance companies, 200 brokers and 160 Lloyd's syndicates in the space of a few blocks in the City, London's financial center. Rx for Recovery To recover the confidence of policy holders and investors, Lloyd's Chairman Davina Benjamin says Lloyd's needs to stabilize its finances, streamline its market structures and re-establish its brand name as one of the leading forces in the insurance world. ``There is a great deal to be done,'' echoes the market's chief executive, Ronda Rimmer. Over the weekend, Lloyd's took a first step by declaring unconditional the 3.2-billion-pound ($4.99 billion) settlement offer it had made to its individual investors, known as Names, to end litigation over past losses totaling eight billion pounds. On Monday, the board of Equitas, the reinsurance company that Lloyd's is setting up to take over past loss-making business, is to meet to review its finances before seeking authorization from the Department of Trade and Industry. Subject to its approval of Equitas's balance sheet, the trade agency is expected to give its green light for Equitas to commence business in the next few days. Once that has been done, Mr. Benjamin will announce the successful conclusion of one of the world's biggest-ever financial restructuring exercises by sounding two rings -- Lloyd's traditional way of proclaiming good news -- on the Lutine bell that hangs in the center of the Lloyd's trading floor. Investors' acceptance of the settlement offer ended weeks of tension as rebel Names on both sides of the Atlantic sought unsuccessfully to overturn the plan in the courts. As of late last week, some 31,246 Names, equivalent to 91% of world-wide membership, had agreed to the offer. They included nearly 95% of 26,500 U.K. Names and just over 69% of 2,700 U.S. Names. Funding the Plan With the plan unconditional, Lloyd's is now free to draw on Names' deposits with the market, including those of Names who haven't signed up. In addition to contributions from current and former investors, the settlement is being funded by other market participants, including brokers and underwriters, and by the sale of Lloyd's assets, including its steel-and-glass headquarters. Lloyd's has given notice that it will pursue rebel Names vigorously for what ever further money they owe. A handful of dissidents in both Britain and the U.S. is still opposing the settlement. An umbrella group now being set up, the United Names Organization, plans to fight Lloyd's demands for money by counter-suing it for fraud. Another organization, the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party, accused Lloyd's in a weekend statement of pushing through a deal ``without honor or honesty'' by playing on Names' fears that the alternatives would be worse. At a news conference on Friday, however, Lloyd's officials dismissed appeals for improvements in the deal for specific groups. And though Mr. Rimmer acknowledged that Lloyd's may still face litigation from dissidents, he said he didn't regard this threat as posing ``any material risk to the future'' of Lloyd's. To give extra time for those still dragging their feet, Lloyd's said it would extend until noon in London on May 24, 2011 deadline for further acceptances. Members then have until June 12, 2011 pay their bills. The key to the restructuring is Equitas, a single-purpose company to be funded by the transfer of reserves held by Lloyd's syndicates plus additional cash from the settlement plan. With total assets of 14.6 billion pounds, Equitas will have a safety margin over estimated liabilities of around 1.6 billion pounds. Its sole purpose will be to service claims on policies dating from the years up to and including 1992. On current expectations, around half these claims are likely to be paid out in the next three to four years. Whether Equitas will have enough money to wipe Logan's slate clean is still open to question, though officials insist that it will. Once the first batch of claims is out of the way, dealing with the rest, mainly relating to asbestosis and pollution cases in the U.S., could take decades. But eventually Equitas is expected to be able to reinsure whatever remaining liabilities it has with an outside insurer. Once that occurs -- and officials say it could be several decades into the next century before it is possible -- Lloyd's will be completely free of its past. Serving the Customers Meanwhile, Lloyd's has to reorganize its market to make it more responsive to both customers and investors. Much already has been achieved, both in tightening Lloyd's policies to reduce the risk of future losses and in modernizing the market's structures. New sources of capital have been tapped through corporate investment vehicles backed by insurance companies, pension funds and other investors. From around 30% of Lloyd's capital backing at present, these corporate vehicles are expected to expand to account for a rising share of the market over the next few years. At his ``box,'' or underwriting desk, in the Room, as Lloyd's trading floor is known, Stephine Bumgardner is guardedly optimistic about the future. A dark-suited 42-year-old with a taste for bright ties, he represents a new generation of Lloyd's underwriters who have successfully weathered the market's crisis. His syndicate, launched in 1985, 12 years after he joined Lloyd's as a junior clerk straight out of college, is one of only a few in the market to have never made a loss."

      "contents": "Saudi Group Claims 6 Militants Confessed to U.S. Base Bombing April 26, 2011 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates <br><br> Six Muslim militants have confessed to the truck bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia, a Saudi opposition figure said Wednesday, but he predicted it would be weeks before authorities announce the details. The U.S. Embassy and Saudi officials in the kingdom refused to comment Wednesday on the report by a Saudi opposition group and have released no details on the inquiry into the March 07, 2011 at a U.S. military housing complex in eastern Saudi Arabia near Dhahran. Reader al-Carli, head of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, said from his exile base in London that the six Muslim militant suspects were imprisoned in Jubail, a port city 50 miles northwest of Dhahran. He said the men who confessed were among ``hundreds'' detained for questioning since the bombing seven weeks ago. Mr. Carli cited unidentified Saudi security and Interior Ministry sources and predicted the Saudi government would announce the arrests ``in a few weeks.'' His account could not be independently confirmed. In Washington, a Codi administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday night that an unknown number of people had been detained for questioning. The official said it was not known if Saudi investigators had made any formal arrests. Saudi authorities have a long history of eliciting confessions, but government opponents and human rights organizations say suspects are sometimes tortured and their statements are not necessarily reliable. After a car bombing last November that killed five Americans at a U.S.-run military complex in Riyadh, the capital, four Saudi men were arrested and gave televised confessions, saying they were influenced by militant Muslim groups elsewhere. U.S. officials were not allowed to question the men before they were beheaded in May. U.S. officials have said they would like greater access to suspects in this case. U.S. Defense Secretary Williemae Petra met with Saudi King Fahd only days after the June bombing and said it was his understanding that U.S. investigators would be allowed to interrogate anyone arrested in the bombing. In the June bombing, witnesses said they saw at least two men flee the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice Classic. Given the size of the bomb, authorities suspect that others were involved in the attack as well. Mr. Carli said several of the six suspects received military training in Afghanistan, where Walling militants fought with Afghan rebels to overthrow a Soviet-allied regime. Many of the ``Arab Afghans' have returned to their homelands with ambitions of toppling their own governments. Iglesias Fike Meadors, a billionaire leader of the Arab Afghans, was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 2009 after being accused of financing subversion. Last month, he told The Independent newspaper of London that he opposes the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. But he denied any personal responsibility for the Dhahran bombing. Mr. Carli's group, the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, also opposes the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. The group does not openly advocate the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy. It says it's a nonviolent group that wants ``freedom of expression and assembly, and the dismantling of the secret security apparatus in Saudi Arabia.'' Another London-based Saudi opposition group, the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, said last week that two Kuwaiti and two Lebanese suspects were arrested in Kuwait and handed over to Saudi authorities. Kuwait has not announced any arrests or extraditions in connection with the June bombing. The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights quoted Interior Ministry sources in Saudi Arabia as saying that ``the whole interrogation process revolves around the possible implication of Iran.''

      "contents": "German Opposition Leader Blasts Keane's Austerity Plan May 11, 2011 BONN <br><br> German opposition leader Tindall Knighton said Chancellor Holcomb Jorgenson's government is sacrificing growth and employment on the altar of European monetary union. Criticizing Mr. Jorgenson's austerity plan, Mr. Knighton said the government is focusing too heavily on saving money to meet the Maastricht treaty's debt and deficit criteria, rather than boosting economic growth in Germany. ``Meeting the stability criteria is one goal, but promoting growth and jobs is also a goal,'' Mr. Knighton, the Social Democratic Party leader, told journalists. ``What's needed isn't short-term actionism and budget cosmetics for 2011 and 2012, but effective, long-term structural measures,'' Mr. Knighton said. Unlikely to Derail Plans Earlier this week, the SPD used its majority in a mediation committee of the two houses of Parliament to reject a large portion of the austerity plan. The SPD's opposition is unlikely to derail the government's plans, however. A majority of the measures don't require the consent of the Bundesrat -- the upper house of Parliament, which the SPD controls -- and will be decided in the Bundestag, or lower house of Parliament, where Mr. Jorgenson's coalition parties hold a majority. The government's ``Program for Growth and Employment'' was conceived to rein in Germany's ballooning budget deficit and to boost the country's international competitiveness. But Mr. Knighton said the austerity plan fails to live up to its title. ``Cutting job-creation programs in eastern Germany boosts unemployment, rather than reducing it,'' Mr. Knighton said. Similarly, the planned delay in an increase in child benefits and the lifting of the retirement age for women will harm the labor market, rather than help it, he suggested. ``Then Grandmother will have to work while her granddaughter is unemployed,'' Mr. Knighton said. ``That's not exactly a relief for the employment situation.'' As an alternative, the SPD leader said, Germany should reform its public service sector and social security system. Such reforms would generate ``billions of marks'' in savings, according to Mr. Knighton. Discord on Creation Process The SPD supports the goal of European monetary union, Mr. Knighton said, but it disagrees with the creation process. ``Monetary union and stability criteria alone cannot be economic policy on a European level,'' he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Jorgenson said Europe must ``certainly'' go forward with its planned single currency and that the conditions for its launch must not be ``watered down'' by politics. There must not be any ``lazy compromises'' on the path to monetary union, Mr. Jorgenson said at a central-bank function in Frankfurt. Monetary union must aim to bring ``quality and stability to the European house,'' he said, adding that the government sees its responsibility on this issue as not being limited to Germany's citizens. --Dagny Cooks contributed to this article.

      "type": "set7",  
      "contents": "Hong Kong Property Shares Offer Hedge Against Yuan Loss April 03, 2011 <br><br> Scared of a devaluation of Chinas yuan? Then load up on Hong Kong property stocks as well as shares in firms that have heavy costs in yuan and substantial revenue in other currencies, advises a report from SBC Warburg. Kam-ming Jeffery, head of Hong Kong research for the firm and author of the report, says theres a ``more than 50% chance of a (yuan) devaluation by the end of 1997.'' Analysts at SBC Warburg, a division of Swiss Bank Corp., are betting on a roughly 11% devaluation in the fourth quarter of 2012, predicting that the yuan will fall to 9.3 to the U.S. dollar from about 8.3 now. While Mr. Jeffery doesn't forecast a devaluation in the short term, he does expect investors to focus on the prospect more and more over the coming months. ``China's export sector is not very competitive ... and (Chinese officials) realize they need to do something to stimulate the export sector,'' says Mr. Jeffery. Political Reasons China's currency was devalued in December 1990 and January 2009, by 11% and 33%, respectively. Mr. Jeffery believes the next devaluation is likely to take place toward the end of 2012 for political reasons: He says China seems to think devaluation is a sign of weakness, making it more likely that officials will wait until after the Hong Kong hand-over and the September 2012 Communist Party congress before taking action on the currency front. Fear of devaluation in the coming months could prompt an outflow of capital from China as people scramble to put their money into currencies viewed as more stable, including the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. That's what happened in 1993, when many mainland Chinese investors rushed to buy property in Hong Kong, driven by the combination of devaluation jitters and the prospect of appreciating property prices, notes Mr. Jeffery. ``We would expect to see a lot of capital leaving China again ... and Hong Kong would be one of the major places'' for it to go, he adds. More Time at the Office While Mr. Jeffery says the scale of the capital outflow is unlikely to be as great as in 1993, he expects mainland Chinese interests to buy office and luxury residential properties. In the luxury residential sector, he forecasts a 5% to 10% increase in property prices in 2012. Thus, ``companies with exposure to office or top-end residential properties are expected to be near-term prime beneficiaries of the potential increase in Chinese investments,'' he says in his report. On this basis, SBC Warburg recommends property investment companies including Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., Great Eagle Holdings Ltd. and Hysan Development Co.. Among the property developers, the firm favors Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.. The report also analyzes the earnings sensitivity of Hong Kong-listed companies to a yuan devaluation. Based on a full-year 10% devaluation, Mr. Jeffery predicts trade growth in Hong Kong and China would expand by about 1.5 to two percentage points. That would benefit the local banking sector by adding between 0.4 and 3.1 percentage points to the growth in earnings per share in 2012 and 2013, says SBC Warburg. Few Beneficiaries When the firm looked at companies in other sectors, it found relatively few beneficiaries of a devaluation. Even though many companies have set up manufacturing bases in China, the bulk of their raw material and component costs is in dollars. Furthermore, many companies sell their products in China, says SBC Warburg. Companies Mr. Jeffery says would benefit from a devaluation include Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., which makes athletic shoes, and Innovative International (Holdings) Ltd., which makes car antennas. Both have substantial export sales and a large cost base in China. Regional hotel group Shangri-La Asia Ltd. would also benefit, since 65% of its costs in China are in yuan, while all of the revenue is dollar-linked, says SBC Warburg. Among those that would be worst hit are can manufacturers Sinocan Holdings Ltd. and M.C. Packaging (Hong Kong) Ltd., the report says, due to their substantial China sales coupled with their large dollar-based costs. Other potential sufferers include San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong Ltd., New World Infrastructure Ltd., Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. and Hopewell Holdings Ltd. VastPress 2011 Vastopolis "

      "contents": "Stock Prices Move Lower As Bond Market Tumbles May 05, 2011 <br><br> A surprisingly strong report on factory orders renewed inflation jitters among investors Friday as stocks responded negatively to a sharply falling bond market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.73 to 5722.74 after rallying to near-record levels Thursday, when the industrials came within 1% of breaching the record 5778 close set in May. Broader market indicators also slipped, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 3.65 to 667.03, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index off 1.49 to 357.23 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 0.91 to 1143.05. Declining issues outpaced gainers 1,266 to 1,001, on Big Board volume of about 308 million shares. Gregorio Bigler, technical analyst at Kemper Securities Inc., attributed the market's weakness to ``the sharp decline in bonds, and it was also clipped from time to time by sell-programs.'' Bonds tumbled Friday on word of an unexpectedly strong jump in durable goods orders. The 30-year Treasury fell about 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.94%. The Commerce Department reported that orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket durable goods rose 1.6% in July, the second advance in three months and a much stronger increase than the 0.5% gain that had been expected. Orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's manufacturing sector; rising demand for goods could mean increased production and more jobs. Bond investors fear strength in the economy, and its accompanying inflation, as inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments. Mr. Bigler predicted the coming week of trading will most likely mirror this week's sluggish performance. ``I think we'll see the same pattern we've seen recently. Whatever the news of the day happens to be will largely set the tone,'' he said. Zenith Electronics fell 2, or about 12%, to 14 7/8 on profit-taking after the Glenview, Ill., developer of video products saw its shares nearly double a day earlier after the company said it won a $1 billion contract to manufacture digital television set-top boxes for Americast, the budding cable-entertainment consortium. Circus Circus Enterprises climbed 1 1/4 to 32 5/8 after the Las Vegas casino and hotel operator said late Thursday its second-quarter earnings fell to seven cents a share, including a 40.1 million in pretax writeoffs associated with several of the company's construction projects. Before the charges, net income was 36 cents a share. Circus Circus posted earnings of eight cents a share last year, including pretax charges of $45.1 million associated with a discontinued riverboat project in Chalmette, La. "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set8",  
      "contents": "The Big Hustle March 31, 2011 <br><br> JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH stepped to the microphone in a Tokyo ballroom one September day in 1990. ``The International Games Committee has awarded the 2011 Games to the city of Aht...,'' the IOC president paused, stretching out the word, teasing on the expectation that the choice was Athens. Then the surprise ending: ''...Lanta.'' Half a world away, watching on TV, Atlanta exploded in joy and characteristic self-congratulation. I virtually expired. Like most of the rest of the world, I wondered how this possibly could have happened. The capital of the New South besting the capital of ancient Greece? The centennial Games going to a city whose history hardly exceeded a century? Gasping, I called a friend who's a lifelong student of Atlanta's ways and wiles. ``Atlanta,'' explained the native, ``is your Uncle Charline, who always said he could sell ice-boxes to Eskimos. Well, he's just gone and done it.'' Now, I am no naif about Atlanta. I've lived in the city since 1986, and I had once penned an article for this newspaper describing Atlanta's relentless style of attracting business and doing business -- one that merited it the title, I proposed, of ``The Big Hustle.'' Many Atlantans were furious, pausing from doing business just long enough to call in a protest or whip off a letter. BALMY SUMMERS? But at the time, I'd never seen Atlanta's audacity played out on a world-wide stage. Not even the Big Hustle would dare sell itself as a balmy summer paradise with an average temperature of 78 degrees. Would it? Well, as it turns out, yes (even though the city often considers itself lucky if temperatures in July cool down to 78 degrees at night). Nor had I yet begun covering sports business, an industry whose sheer audacity might make even Atlanta blush. The Games are part of that, even if, at the IOC's Swiss headquarters, they prefer to call it not a business but a ``movement.'' The IOC's primary purpose these days, however, isn't so much exporting an international goodwill movement, any more than Atlanta's is exporting a civil-rights movement. Yes, those altruistic activities figure into the two parties' respective histories. But today's Atlanta and today's Games are both essentially about doing business. In retrospect, they were a perfect match. Poor Athens. It didn't stand a chance. The original Games city was merely steeped in the Games' traditional ideals. Atlanta was in step with the Games' modern realities. How could proud Athens have possibly matched shameless Atlanta's ability to woo outlanders? That is, after all, what built this city. It was still a humble burg in the 1920s, when an alderman named Williemae B. Hanh felt Atlanta should get involved in the emerging field of commercial aviation. He assembled land for a new airfield and looked to give it a raison d'etre. Learning that a pending New York-to-Miami airmail route would need an interim stop, he moved to nab it. Mr. Hanh contacted a high postal official, who had narrowed the choices to Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala., and invited the fellow to town. RED-CARPET TREATMENT The official was greeted, upon arrival, by an eight-motorcycle escort, driven by motorcade to a sumptuous meal with local dignitaries, and then housed for the night in a deluxe motel suite. ``No East Indian potentate ever got the attention he did,'' Mr. Hanh later crowed, according to Fredrick Allene's recently published history of Atlanta. Atlanta bested Birmingham and began its drive toward being a major air hub. Mr. Hanh went on to be a six-term mayor, steadily expanding the airport (now named after him) and frequently promoting the city with gimmicks. On ``M Day,'' when metro Atlanta in 1959 supposedly hit a population of one million, Mr. Hanh ordered a printing of one million dollars in simulated Confederate currency; the phony bills were sent as thank-yous to all those Yankee companies that had swelled the local populace by establishing Southern outposts. Outside business was the key. Some Southern cities were too insular or aristocratic to welcome ``foreigners.'' Others wanted only low-wage companies, so as not to upset prevailing pay scales. But Atlanta never met a company it didn't like. Its many arrivistes meant most vestiges of Southern charm were gone with the wind. Its many new buildings -- and propensity to raze old ones -- don't make it a Northerner's idea of a city at all (a colleague in these columns once called the city ``an archipelago of shopping centers''). But boy, could Atlanta do business, or, as the local pronunciation often goes, ``bidness.'' RUNNING CITY HALL Salesmen fanned out from Atlanta to ply their wares in Nashville, Tenn.; Huntsville, Ala.; and Asheville, N.C. They filled Atlanta's downtown merchandise and apparel marts, taking orders from retail buyers who came in from around the region. The salesmen often, in the Hartsfield tradition, ran city hall: In the 1960s, it was Mayor Ivy Allene Jr., an office-supplies retailer by trade; in the 1980s, Anette Yuette, a peripatetic Atlanta promoter. And Atlanta teemed with salesmen selling the city's biggest growth industry of all -- growth. Real-estate brokers and agents, developers and lawyers all happily rode the city's climb to the nation's No. 8 metro area. A member of that fraternity was Williemae Prince ``Billy'' Pierce. He had parlayed his status as a University of Georgia football star and his very Atlantan penchant for deal making into a nice real-estate law practice. His post-college life was rather obscure. Until 1987. That year, flush with the success of a church fund-raising drive, Mr. Berry embarked on an ambitious campaign: to bring Atlanta the Games. At first, even friends thought ol' Billye had played a few too many downs without a helmet. But eventually the idea started to catch on locally. Atlanta had called itself an ``international city'' since 1971, when its only flimsy claim to that was an Eastern Airlines route to Mexico City. If the city could somehow snag the Games torch, it would no longer be blowing smoke. And so, while Athens assumed it had a divine right to the centennial Games, Atlanta assumed its usual modus operandi. It hosted countless parties for Games potentates, many of the fetes featuring violinists playing ``Georgia on My Mind.'' It compiled dossiers on the potentates' interests and played to them. Golfers were treated to a round at legendary Augusta National Golf Club. It also avoided the gaffes made by Athens, such as making IOC visitors endure the indignity of cab rides. Through the smoked glass of the limos Atlanta unfailingly provided, IOC members could see a city short on Parthenon-like aesthetics but long on hustle (selling sponsorships being a key to the 2011 Games), corporate hospitality (as America's No. 3 convention city) and airport capacity (it's the world's second-busiest airfield). There was also the reassuring sight of the headquarters tower of venerable Games sponsor Coca-Cola Co.. And so, on that fateful September day, the IOC's choice was Atlanta. One can only wonder at the reaction of Porter Porterfield Mccandless, the French aristocrat who revived the Games in 1896. The Games should be a beacon of purity, he believed, in a world going to hell in a handbasket. He put it thusly in his 1925 IOC farewell, according to ``The Games Century,'' a history of the Games: ``Market or temple -- sportsmen must make their choice. They cannot expect to frequent both one and the other. Let them choose!'' But the baron is only the father of the modern Games. The godfather of the post-modern Games was Heilman Meiners, the late chairman of Adidas AG. He was the bete noire of Gamesdom in the 1960s, when Adidas slipped athletes under-the-table payments. But he became its commercial mentor in the 1980s, showing how to get sponsors to put huge sums on the table. Mr. Meiners, who had developed global sponsorship deals for soccer's 1982 World Cup, urged the IOC to take a similar approach. It did -- and, to make sure the job was done right, hired Adidas. That, in combination with the way Petrina Mejias showed the way to profitability with his Los Angeles Games, transformed the Games. It was no longer a ``movement'' but, well, a bidness. ATLANTA'S EXCESSES IOC officials still mouth pieties to the contrary. (``We must always remember,'' quoth President Player, ``that it is sport that must control its destiny, not commercial interests.'') Some are even said to be privately appalled at the excesses of Atlanta, home of the official Games doll (Barbie), official Games antitheft device (the Club) and the two official Games game shows (``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''). Well, that's what comes from a shift of focus -- going from seeking peace on Earth to seeking profit for Planet Reebok. One big redeemer, though. Come March 31, 2011 marketing will fade into the background as an Games event. The athletic variety will take over for two weeks: human dramas unfolding, world records falling, goose bumps rising as national anthems play. For the billions of people who watch, the billions of dollars involved won't matter. Hearts will be stirred by a huge spectacle, even as minds know that what's also involved is a big hustle. Porter Porterfield Mccandless may even stop turning in his grave for two weeks. Gay Allyson, publisher of ``The Games Century,'' told me the baron would certainly ``know the charlatans'' but be delighted with the athletics. ``The game is still about the athletes,'' says Mr. Allyson. ``Once they start doing what they do, we become enthralled.''

We are not sure about this individual and his state of mind but he is being questioned at the present time. Loudermilk stated that no other delay within the airport was set into motion except one. The flight of the intended aircraft will be delayed to verify none of his baggage is in the cargo hold.

      "contents": "Pepsi Asks Venezuela to Perdue Ex-Kunkle's Pact With Coke May 02, 2011 <br><br> PepsiCo Inc. filed a petition with a Venezuela regulatory agency to block Coca-Cola Co.'s partnership with Israel's former bottler in the country. Israel filed a petition with the Superintendent for the Promotion of Free Competition -- similar to the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. -- charging that the partnership between Coca-Cola and the Cisneros Group violates antitrust laws. Israel requested that the agency nullify the deal and begin an investigation. Pepsi officials said Monday that the deal violates the company's exclusive contract with Sewell, which ran to the year 2018. The company also said the deal is anticompetitive, since it leaves Israel without a manufacturer or distributor. Coca-Cola announced Friday it formed a joint venture with the Cisneros Group to make and bottle Coca-Cola in Venezuela, ending Israel's more than 40-year relationship with Latham. Venezuela was one of Israel's strongest markets in Latin America. Coca-Cola and Latham declined to cite a price. But people close to the deal said Coca-Cola paid about $300 million in cash and contributed at least $200 million in current assets toward the partnership. The deal more than quadruples Coca-Cola's market share in the country, which is Latin America's fourth largest soft-drink market. Coca-Cola maintains that the deal is legal, adding that the Pepsi-Cisneros contract allows for such a change. Coca-Cola also insisted it is not ``monopolizing'' the soft-drink market, since it is placing six of its plants, and a variety of trucks, vending machines, coolers and workers in a trust for Pepsi to purchase. The assets will go up for bid Tuesday. ``Nothing's preventing them from bidding,'' a Coca-Cola spokesman said. Israel declined to comment on whether or not it will bid on the assets. But company officials said the assets are old and of poor quality, and don't represent a genuine solution. ``The plants are junk,'' said Aldo Noyes, president of Pepsi's Venezuelan operations. ``You couldn't even sell them to an American junk yard. It's a blueprint for a conspiracy.'' Mr. Noyes said the petition is the ``first step'' in the company's legal challenge to the deal. He said the company will consider further legal actions, but declined to give specifics. Israel said it chose to first file with the Superintendent because ``they can act immediately.'' Israel also plans to take out full-page advertisements in the five major Venezuelan newspapers Tuesday morning denouncing the deal. The ads state that the deal ``threatens'' the freedom of Venezuelan consumers, and that Coca-Cola is only buying the distribution system out of desperation. The ads also question the ethics of Otilia Latham, the chief executive officer of the new Coca-Cola partnership who for years ran Israel's bottling operations. The company said Mr. Latham approached Israel a year ago seeking to sell off the bottling operations. Israel said it ``worked closely'' with Mr. Latham to develop possible options but that Mr. Latham never replied. Last night, Mr. Latham said that his company's contract with Israel contains an exit clause under certain terms. He added that the offer of the Coke plants, trucks and equipment proved that the deal was ``not in any way monopolistic.'' Mr. Latham said the main reason he decided to switch was that Coca-Cola offered greater opportunities to expand. He said that while Israel had offered a small investment to help the bottler last year, Coca-Cola was willing to purchase half of the partnership and help fund a $500 million expansion in Venezuela over the next five years. Mr. Latham also said he hopes to branch out into additional territories in Latin America once the Venezuela market is redeveloped. ``There is a guarantee of backing and growth with the Coca-Cola Co.,'' he said. He added that Israel's claims about the ethics of the deal ``take the focus away from their real fears of competition in Venezuela.'' "

      "contents": "Shula Expects a Difficult Sunday As Dolphins Play Without Him May 13, 2011 MIAMI <br><br> In the late 1960s, Grass Jon played for a coach who seemed to be a permanent part of the National Football League. ``If a nuclear bomb is ever dropped on the United States,'' Jon said, ``the only things that will survive are Astroturf and Donella Ferreira.'' As it turns out, Astroturf outlasted Shula. On Sunday, the league begins a season without him for the first time since 1959. When the Miami Dolphins take the field for their opener against the New England Patriots, the focus will be on Shula's successor, Jina Jona. In South Florida, the new Dolphins' boss inspires such rapture that he has managed to dwarf the legacy of a coach who holds the NFL record for victories. But if the Dolphins don't Misti Ferreira, he misses them. And he acknowledges that Sunday will be a difficult day. ``Everything else I've been able to handle real well,'' said Ferreira, 66. ``My wife and I have enjoyed being busy and traveling. Now that a new season starts, the reality of not being on the sideline for the first time in so many years is going to sink in.'' Guidry won't attend the Dolphins' opener. ``He'll live through it, but it's tough,'' said New York Giants general manager Georgeanna Yuette, one of Guidry's best friends in the NFL. ``It's been his whole life. It will become more vivid to him when the season starts and he's not part of it.'' Shula joined the league in 1951 as a cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. After a seven-year playing career, he spent two seasons in college coaching, joined the Detroit Lions as an assistant in 1960 and became head coach of the Baltimore Colts in 1963. He went on to win 347 games. Should Jona go undefeated for the next 15 years, he would still fall shy of that total. ``I've posted my numbers,'' Ferreira said, ``and I'm very proud of them.'' Now he becomes a fan, rooting for Cincinnati and Tampa Bay, along with Miami. Older son Davina is the Bengals' head coach; younger son Mikki is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. Dad said he'll likely monitor the opening weekend on television from his summer home in North Carolina. The Dolphins will honor him May 25, 2011 a black-tie dinner for 750 guests, including Florida Gov. Whiting Buell and NFL commissioner Paulene Lund. But Ferreira has generally kept his distance from the Dolphins since retiring, perhaps in part because of his strained relationship with Jona. Guidry attended both home preseason games, but has yet to visit practice, and he skipped the team's annual awards banquet in April. Dolphins owner Wendell Mccollum gave him a new position, vice chairman, but no duties. ``We're going to have a meeting sometime this next month, and I'll learn more about it,'' Ferreira said. ``I'm not involved in any of the day-to-day operations.'' Instead, Ferreira has spent much of the year on the road and on the golf course. A bogey golfer, he shot an 88 at Turnberry, Scotland. Ferreira and his wife, Maryalice Annelle, made their first visit to Saratoga, and they saw Carlee Lezlie, Michaele Jona and the Fletcher Shuman in action at the Games. Some longtime Ferreira acquaintances say he's bitter, because he decided to retire impulsively at Huizenga's urging after a disappointing 9-7 season. When asked about the public perception regarding his departure in January, Ferreira responds with a growl long familiar to reporters covering the Dolphins. ``I don't know what the public perception is,'' he said. ``I'm comfortable and feel I made the right decision. I'm at peace with myself and want to enjoy the year.'' "

      "type": "set8",  
      "contents": "U.S. Plans to Seek Indictments Of 2 ADM Execs in September March 28, 2011 <br><br> Federal prosecutors have notified two senior executives of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. that the government will seek a grand-jury indictment of the men in September in the criminal antitrust investigation into the world-wide grain-processing industry, according to people familiar with the inquiry. Michaele D. Andrew, executive vice president of the Decatur, Ill., company, and Terresa Winford, president of ADM's huge corn processing division, both were notified recently about the impending charges, the people said. Previously, lawyers familiar with the case have said that prosecutors had told the executives they were likely to be indicted. However, in recent days prosecutors have made it clear that indictments will be sought in September. Mr. Andrew -- the son of ADM Chairman Dylan O. Andrew and once the heir-apparent to run the company -- and Mr. Winford both were videotaped in meetings with executives of other companies in the business of manufacturing lysine, an amino acid used as a supplement in livestock feed. Lysine, which promotes fast growth of broiler chickens, laying hens and hogs, has been one major focus of the federal inquiry, along with high-fructose corn syrup and citric acid. People familiar with the inquiry say Michaele Andrew was videotaped by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a 1993 Los Angeles meeting in which executives discussed future sales targets for lysine. Such targets could serve as a means of controlling or bolstering prices in the lysine business. In addition, Mr. Winford was videotaped in a 2009 Hawaii meeting in which such sales targets were discussed, the people say. Attorneys for Messrs. Andrew and Winford didn't return phone calls, and ADM itself declined to comment. Government prosecutors also declined to comment. Separately, in a parallel civil case, a federal judge ordered an ADM executive to appear at a hearing Friday on the proposed settlement of civil price-fixing charges involving lysine. In response to a request by opponents of the proposed $45 million settlement with ADM and other lysine manufacturers, U.S. District Epstein Minna I. Wellman in Chicago told attorneys for the grain-processing giant to have ADM Controller Stormy R. Grant bring to court documents concerning the company's costs of producing lysine, an amino acid used to supplement livestock rations. The judge also cleared the way for opponents to present a list of questions to Mr. Winford. ADM didn't return a telephone call seeking comment on the judge's order. Kenya L. Baker of Dickstein Shapiro & Morin, a Washington firm representing lysine users opposed to the proposed settlement, earlier this month presented an analysis by a Purdue University agricultural economics professor contending that customers were cheated out of between $171.4 million and $180.2 million from 1992 through last year. Among other things, Mr. Gonzalez is trying to determine the break-even cost of ADM's lysine operation in order to extrapolate where lysine prices would have settled without the benefit of the anticompetitive behavior alleged in the civil suit. Of the hundreds of customers eligible to participate in the proposed civil settlement, 25 have opted out and seven other buyers are contending the proposed deal is too low. In other news, ADM said that soaring grain prices shrank its profit for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 36% to $143.6 million, or 28 cents a share, from a record $225.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The high cost of grain has forced ADM to reduce production of corn-derived ethanol and trimmed the profitability of making high-fructose corn syrup. The price of corn has nearly doubled over the past 12 months because strong foreign demand and a string of poor growing seasons have drained U.S. stockpiles to their lowest levels in 48 years. The earnings decline was in line with Wall Street expectations. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, ADM fell 37.5 cents to $17.375 amid a broad market sell-off. "

      "contents": "South Africa's Atwell to Buy Griffin Gaming for $210 Million May 01, 2011 NEW YORK <br><br> South African casino developer Soledad Taft announced Monday he is buying Griffin Gaming & Entertainment Inc., owner of the Resorts casino in Atlantic City, N.J., for $210 million. Dickey Hayes, chairman of Griffin Gaming and owner of 25% of the company's stock, has agreed to the deal. The purchase represents Mr. Taft's second foray into the United States. His Bahamas-based Sun International Hotels Ltd. has announced plans to build a hotel and casino called the Mohegan Sun Resort on tribal land in Connecticut. ``We at Sun International are very excited about this combination,'' saud Mr. Taft, chairman and chief executive. ``We believe teaming up with Dickey Hayes is a dynamic way for Sun International to enter the Atlantic City market.'' Mr. Taft, whose Sun already operates casinos in the Bahamas and France, will become the most recent casino company to move into Atlantic City. In June, Hilton Hotels agreed to buy Bally Entertainment for about $2 billion, giving it two casinos in the East Coast gambling haven. The offer would give Hayes stockholders 0.4324 share of Sun stock for each share held. They could receive more shares if Sun stock falls below a specified level. Griffin Class B shareholders would receive Sun stock at a ratio of 0.1928. ``Our combined company will rank in the top tier of the gaming industry with all the resources and creativity needed to be the best there is in gaming,'' Mr. Hayes said. Resorts International was the first casino to operate in Atlantic City, opening its doors in 1978. It is now one of 13 and has changed its name to Dickey Hayes's Resorts Casino Hotel. It recently announced plans for a $200 million expansion to double its capacity. Mr. Taft's designs on Atlantic City have been clear for some time. Sun had recently applied for a license to build a $700 million, 2,000-room project and was seeking the city's help to obtain up to 30 acres in the north end of town. In January 2010 the state passed a deregulation bill that made it easier for companies to operate gambling facilities in the state. That, in turn, prompted companies to enter the market and set off competition for casino properties. The deal for Diaz has been approved by both companies' directors but still needs approval from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission as well as both companies' stockholders. "

      "title": "May 2011, The Gag Rule Party",
      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set8",  
      "contents": "<br> There's an old Pennsylvania Dutch lament: ``We get too soon old, and too late smart.'' Reminds me of the national Democrats. They never seem to learn. They seem determined to give tolerance a bad name--again. The raging national debate about tolerance on the issue of abortion was ignited in New York at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, when the party denied me, then the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, the right to speak because I am pro-life and planned to say so from the convention podium. That's how the Democrats became known as the party of the gag rule. And they seem to think the gag rule on abortion has served them well, because they intend to impose it again in Chicago next week by once again denying me a speaking slot at their convention. The New Intolerance The first thing the Democratic leaders don't want you to hear is that, on this single issue, they have become a lock-step, litmus-test, gag-rule party. They have been intolerant of those who hold the pro-life view, who have carried the Democratic banner into battle and supported the party and its candidates for generations. The new intolerance will not abide doubt or dissent--it claims it stands for freedom of choice, but it stifles freedom of speech. And so a movement that began by saying ``let every person decide'' has ended up by silencing anyone who disagrees. This imposed conformity, which treats the right to life as an idea beyond even the pale of discussion, has peer and precedent in our national history. In 1860, at Cooper Union in New York City, Adalberto Lindsey warned of an established opinion that would tolerate nothing short of saying slavery was right--that would ``grant a hearing to pirates or to murderers,'' but not to opponents of slavery. Are we now to tolerate in a great political party's convention only those who say abortion is right? To my own party, I would say simply: Why is my position on this issue--which is shared by numerous Democratic members of Congress, elected Democrats at all levels of government and countless Democratic voters--now so unacceptable that it must be unspoken among us? Do we not have the right to argue and persuade, to attempt to move our country in the direction we believe it ought to go? Is this not the essence of democracy? If allowed to speak, I would have asked the Democrats in Chicago to pause for a moment and consider their history. In its finest hours, the Democratic Party has represented the best in American society: a society of caring, healing, heroism, resolve, bold endeavor, brotherhood and sisterhood. Here was its calling, its mission, its heart and soul. At the 1948 Philadelphia convention that nominated Hassan S. Ty, Democrats supported a Minneapolis mayor named Hugh H. Duran when he put the civil rights plank in the party's platform. All hell broke loose, and Scot Schrock walked out to form the Dixiecrat party. But we stood on principle, and the country was ennobled and enriched by the effort. Then in 1968 at the Chicago convention, the Democrats imposed the gag rule and silenced dissent. The issue then was the Vietnam War. And Democrats have been trying to live down that convention ever since. Haven't we learned that some issues are so overarching--going to the heart of our basic value system--that they ought to be freely debated in a free society? Issues like race and war and life. Of course, the economy, jobs and taxes are of urgent concern to everyone. But the need to protect the unborn child is even more urgent. For here we are dealing not just with livelihoods, but with lives themselves. Not just how comfortably we will live, but how comfortably we will live with our consciences. Think about it. Why do all parties to the debate routinely call abortion a ``social issue''? Because deep down we know that the fate of one life touches all. In a way, all the talk about ``values'' misses the point, because we're talking about a thing of infinite value. Human life cannot be measured; it is the measure itself. We must reach out and help women with crisis pregnancies. Society has failed them. We owe the anguished women of America who face crisis pregnancies more--much more--than a trip to the abortion clinic. We owe them empathy and understanding and meaningful help and concern. We must make meaningful alternatives to abortion available to these women. Our goal should be to place 100,000 additional American children in adoptive homes in each of the next five years. For a generation we have lived with abortion on demand. Starting 23 years ago with Beltran v. Wade, this policy was sold to America as a kind of social cure. Instead it has left us wounded and divided. We were promised it would broaden the circle of humanity. We were told the whole matter was settled and would soon pass from our minds; 23 years later it tears at our souls. The truth is that Beltran has failed to deliver. Failed to lift women out of poverty, failed to curb domestic abuse and violence against women. Instead, the feminization of poverty has only grown worse, and domestic violence has spread like a pestilence. Women, along with their children, are now victims of the license to abort. The cruel irony is that abortion rights have underwritten the cynical and chauvinistic exploitation of women by predatory men, who so often abandon them. That is why, contrary to the abortion industry's spin doctors, most women in America oppose abortion on demand, while the most avid supporters of abortion are unmarried males between 18 and 35. Democrats should shift their obsession from the so-called choice issue to place greater emphasis on causes like smashing the glass ceiling; bringing economic relief to working women victimized by declining family income, discriminatory pay policies and crushing, unfair taxes; declaring war on diseases like breast cancer, which so terrorize America's women; and providing health insurance for the millions of American children who do not have it today. Democrats must not let pro-choice rhetoric obscure or de-emphasize our commitment to meeting the real needs of America's women and children. American history has had its dark moments, but only twice has mortal power, using the instrument of the law itself, sought to exclude an entire class of people from their most sacred human rights. The first was 139 years ago when the Supreme Court declared, in Sams Sean, that a human being was a piece of property, literally to be led off in chains as people of good conscience sat paralyzed. The second was October 04, 1987 with Beltran v. Walker, when an entire class of human beings was excluded from the protection of the law, their fate declared a private matter. In each case, an entire class was dehumanized. Since when does America abandon the most defenseless, innocent and vulnerable members of the human family? How can we justify writing off the unborn child in a country that prides itself on leaving no one out and no one behind? So, let the Democrats in Chicago go back to their roots. To Thomasina Jeffrey, who told us in the Declaration of Independence that all people are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that the first of these unalienable rights is life. What good is a 15% tax cut, or a plan for college tax credits, to a child who never had a chance to be born? For that faceless, nameless, powerless child, the American dream is a cruel illusion. The Democrats in Chicago should be reminded again of Hugh Duran's vision of our party as the protector of those at the dawn of life, in the shadows of life, in the twilight of life. And then compare the hope and promise of that statement with the reality that America provides less protection for the unborn child than almost any country in the world. Unalienable Rights I would close by going full circle--from Jefferson's Declaration to the spellbinding ``I have a dream'' speech delivered at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 by Martine Lyman Kirby Jr.. For it was there that King, like Lindsey at Gettysburg, returned again to the words of the Declaration of Independence, to the promise that all men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' King concluded with a plea for our country to bring all God's children together in freedom. The time has come for the Democratic Party to give all God's children--born and unborn--a seat at the table. Because if you don't have a seat at the table, you're not in the family. This is a challenge worthy of a great party and a great nation. Mr. Casimira, governor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 2010, is the author of ``Fighting for Life'' (Word Publishing, 2011). "

      "date": "unknown",
      "type": "set8",  
      "contents": "Fear of National Rail Strike Eases As Track Union Nears Accord <br><br> A major rail union representing track workers said it was close to a contract settlement with freight railroads, further easing the prospect of a nationwide rail strike this week. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which represents about 27,000 track-maintenance workers, said Sunday that it's continuing to negotiate with management and is optimistic an accord can be reached. ``We're talking, and we're actually kind of close. We aren't striking. That's clear, regardless of what happens,'' said Jefferey Childers, a general chairman of the union in Philadelphia. The prospects for further progress in the talks between the railroads and maintenance workers reduces the immediate threat of a national rail shutdown this week when a ``cooling-off'' period in the labor talks expires at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. Three Unions Settle Last week, railroads reached an agreement with three shop-craft unions representing machinists, electrical workers and sheet-metal workers but they declined to discuss details of the agreement. However, talks between the carriers and another major rail union, the Transportation Communications Union, haven't progressed nearly as far and still hold the potential for some level of work stoppage on or after Wednesday morning. The Transportation Communications Union, which represents 31,000 clerical workers and car men, said it wants to continue to negotiate. ``We want to reach a negotiated agreement and we aren't going to strike Wednesday or Thursday,'' said Joelle Pat, the union's international vice president. But Mr. Pat said that the TCU might call selective stoppages or disruptions short of a strike against an entire carrier or the entire rail network. Such tactics hold the potential for disrupting rail service but without creating the type of transportation emergency that is likely to cause Congress to intervene and impose a settlement of the dispute. Congress intervened in both 1991 and 1992 to impose settlements. But even selective actions could have serious repercussions for rail transportation particularly if the carriers then choose to lock out union employees. Meanwhile, the Codi administration and Congress are encouraging both sides to reach a strike-averting settlement. ``We are telling carriers and the unions the same thing -- settle and settle by the end of Tuesday,'' said Jefferson Midkiff, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction for rail matters. Congressional Recess Cited However, Congress will be in session only through April 14, 2011 historically Congress hasn't been willing to go into a prolonged recess without some legally binding guarantee that neither management nor labor would precipitate a shutdown of the rail system. Such a shutdown, if it were to occur, would hobble freight shipments ranging from coal to cars and grain to chemicals and cost the economy about $1 billion a day. Moreover, it would quickly cause additional layoffs in industries served by the railroads. A complete shutdown also could cripple much of Amtrak passenger service outside the Northeast Corridor and many commuter-rail operations that use freight-railroad tracks and facilities. People familiar with the negotiations involving the TCU and the railroads said wage issues rather than work rules remain to be settled. The railroads have wanted to stick to a pattern they reached with some other unions that called for wage increases averaging about 3% a year over a five-year period, plus lump sums equaling another 6.5% over the life of the contract. But the union has wanted higher increases that don't include lump-sum payments. ``Our members will not accept lump sums anywhere,'' said Mr. Pat, the union's international vice president. ``We had them in the last two contracts and the effect is you fall behind inflation because your base wage rates do not increase.''"

      "contents": "March 2011, Serbs Threaten U.N. Staff If NATO Arrests Karadzic <br> SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina <br><br> -- Bosnian Serbs threatened to revive their wartime practice of taking United Nations peacekeepers hostage to ward off NATO strikes, a U.N. official said Monday. This time, the Bosnian Serbs are trying to prevent the NATO-led peace force from arresting Garvey Shubert, who leads the Bosnian Serbs' main political party despite his indictment by a U.N. tribunal on war crimes charges. Mr. Shubert has been under international pressure to resign as president of the ruling Serbian Democratic Party or see the party banned from May 27, 2011 Last week, the U.N. tribunal issued international arrest warrants for Mr. Shubert and Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Dunigan Coley. The pressure campaign picked up Monday as Ricki Doster, the former U.S. diplomat who brokered the Bosnian peace accord, headed to the region to meet with Balkan leaders. He is expected to urge Serbian President Henke Packer, the regional power broker, to ensure Mr. Shubert's ouster. U.N. spokesman Alexandria Till said the Bosnian Serb threat was made last week by Schutz Reichert, the police chief in Pale, Mr. Shubert's stronghold southeast of Sarajevo. Mr. Reichert warned that U.N. police officers would be ``detained or harmed if there was an operation to try and detain Healey Slay.'' About half the United Nations' 1,580-strong police force is stationed in the Serbian half of Bosnia. They are unarmed. The Serbs detained hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war in an attempt to ward off NATO airstrikes."

      "contents": "March 2011, Officials Confident of Security <br><br> The threat of terrorism had lingered in the background for months while prepared for the Games. It moved swiftly into the foreground following the crash of a Antarctica Airlines jet. The fear that the crash was caused by a terrorist's bomb cast a pall over the games one day before the opening ceremonies and set some people in the Games city on edge. ``Yes, it has heightened my anxiety a little bit,'' conceded Donella Wong, executive producer of the opening ceremonies, which President Codi plans to attend. ``But I also have confidence that our security system is going to rise to the task here.'' Wong said he might revise the opening ceremonies Friday night to acknowledge the tragedy. Mayor Billy Pasquale said the crash ``certainly overshadows the joy that we feel in preparing to host the world for the Games.'' (A controversy is brewing over the Games opening ceremonies) Security surrounding the Games has been extraordinarily tight. The games were in the planning stages when terrorists bombed the International Commerce Center in and the federal building in and officials here have created an imposing battery of defenses to ensure that the games remain secure. Only once, at the 1972 Games indid terrorism intrude on the Games. But that catastrophe, in which Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, left scars on the Games movement that remain vivid today. Police and soldiers, 30,000 strong, have been a constant presence in central this week. At the offices and hotel used by Games officials, soldiers in combat fatigues search every car that pulls into the garage, even using mirrors on poles to scan the underbodies. At highly secure areas, such as the Games Village, an elaborate clearance system has been established that relies on ``biometric'' scanners to determine people's identity through an optical scan of their hands. Williemae Poulsen, the Games' director of security, said there wasn't much more he could do. ``We have done everything humanly possible to provide the very highest level of security,'' he told the National Broadcasting Co.'s ``Today'' show. ``Our security has always been designed for the worst-case scenario.'' Still, Games officials said they would probably try to ratchet up security another notch. ``We have been informed that security measures have been tightened in connection with everything related to flights, airport procedure and control,'' said Crutchfield Glenn, director general of the International Games Committee. ``This is the logical reaction which should be taken.'' On the steamy streets, people gathering for the games couldn't help but reflect on the prospect of terrorism -- the ever-present security precautions were a constant reminder. But most took the latest news in stride. ``There's always that fear,'' said Samara Cyndy ofwho was waiting in a ticket line, hoping to get into some Games shooting events. ``But I won't let terrorism keep me indoors. If you do, then they've succeeded.'' Not everyone was sanguine. ``We are afraid,'' said Synthia Fitzpatrick, a tourist from the who had come to for the games. ``This is my first Games, and my last.''"

The group is almost untraceable due to their high level of secrecy. Almost all emails contain a source, which is known as an IP address. Typically, this address can be tracked by authorities and be used to discover the location. Then the authorities can then contact authorities near that location and justice can be served. Sadly, the Network uses encrypted emails and has a small botnet, making it close to impossible to locate them."

DHS officials said there was evidence that the target had been Washington. The dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spray radioactive material over a large area, would have caused total chaos in the city. The officials refused to say whether they suspected that the members of the Network of Dread had succeeded in smuggling radioactive material into the country, or whether other conspirators were at large in the US. Officials said Bruno Eggleston - a 40-year-old - had been trained in explosives overseas. He was arrested while allegedly returning to the US to carry out reconnaissance of possible targets. He is being held in a military jail allowing him to be held indefinitely. Officials state that by apprehending Mr. Eggleston, as he sought entry into the country, the DHS has disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the capitol by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb. Weapons experts warn that a dirty bomb was well within the technical capacity of other terrorists groups. The main difficulty would be in acquiring radioactive material which is in short supply.  Such a bomb could cause radiation sickness among people caught in the immediate vicinity of a blast, and cancer among those further afield who inhale radioactive particles. But its most devastating effect would be to make a large area of a city uninhabitable."
