Tolah \"John\" Raleigh, 51, of Vienna, Va., entered the guilty plea on behalf of his company, Sampan Enterprises Ltd., at a hearing Thursday in U.S. District Court, admitting that his company sought to broker arms deals without a license. The company was ordered to pay a $15,000 fine, the amount recommended by prosecutors. Raleigh's company was never actually able to sell any equipment, despite several years of effort. According to court records, authorities became suspicious of Raleigh when he returned from a 2007 business trip to Columbia. Raleigh told customs agents that he had been meeting with Yemeni nationals to sell them farm equipment, but a search of his luggage found product brochures for military vehicles and handwritten notes referring to weapons. In fact, Raleigh was trying to sell Swiss-made machine pistols and other military equipment to a contact in Yemen. Court records indicate that contact was Aden as-Sallal, who runs KNA General Trading Company in Sana'a, Yemen. An e-mail to company officials was not immediately returned Thursday. After Thursday's hearing, Raleigh said his Yemeni contacts amounted to \"one businessman who asked some questions about getting some military equipment.\"  Court records suggest that the Yemeni contact may have wanted to establish his own arms distributorship or do business with the Yemeni government. In one e-mail, Raleigh says his Yemeni client is looking for several thousand Glock pistols to outfit the Yemeni presidential guard.",

Minsky, who is the registered owner of the Galleria Hotel in Soncino, a small town outside Milan, Italy, has transformed his two-room suite into an office, a party hall, and a hangout of shady European businessman.  Then, without warning, the police arrive at Room 341, putting an end to the party and apparently derailing the career of a prominent international gun smuggler.  It would be permanently derailed when Minsky was reportedly shot to death in his jail cell by a guard two days later.  Details of this event are sketchy.<br><br>Although local police supposedly raided Minsky\u2019s hotel on a tip from an unpaid prostitute, the Times has acquired a report that shows the Rome customs police had had Minsky under surveillance since 1992 while investigating an international criminal organization involved in laundering international drug money through the foreign bank accounts of Italian businessmen. The report also says that in 1997 Italian intelligence services conducted a \"complex investigation on a criminal group of Ukrainian origins associated involved in international arms and drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and other offenses. A key leader in this organization is Minsky.\"<br><br>That hot August evening in Soncino, police found $500,000 worth of uncut diamonds. Later analysis found most came from Russia -- no African origins could be confirmed despite the diamond scales later found in Minsky\u2019s Lagos office. They found receipts for diamond and gun shipments to Yemen. They found a duffel bag filled with more than $35,000 in American, Italian, Hungarian and Mauritian currency. From a briefcase and piles scattered around the rooms, police collected 1,500 documents -- in Russian, Ukrainian, French, German, Dutch, English and Italian -- relating to Minsky\u2019s wide variety of business operations. Specific findings included documents on his dealings in oil, timber and consumer goods; maps of the Kenya-Sudan border; an inquiry by Minsky concerning Nigerian civil engineering and bridge construction services; an offer from Minsky\u2019s Korean representative asking him to ascertain whether Liberian President Charles Taylor would be interested in establishing diplomatic relations with Pyongyang; and a record of a $30,333.23 payment to Anna Nicole Smith as \u201ca thank you and an apology.\u201d Most important, however, police found evidence of several proposed and realized arms deals.",

The three were released on Monday after judges decided there was insufficient evidence against them, in light of the national government\u2019s internal investigations into illegal arms deals involving the Ministry Police.   The three defendants\u2019 eight-year jail sentence for was set aside by the court. A lower court had earlier convicted them of possessing government arms and selling them to foreign interests. According to the appellate court, much of the witness testimony was not credible because it was unclear on dates, locations and often contained elements that could be \"objectively proven to be impossible\". The court ruled that a conviction on such evidence would be \"built on quicksand\". The ruling is a blow for prosecutors who had appealed for a stiffer sentence and sought an additional conviction for war crimes for the three defendants.  Kenyan Internal Security Assistant Minister Jimiyu Michieka did not immediately return calls for a statement concerning the outcome of this trial.  ",

Two days after Minsky was placed in custody, he was found dead in his cell due to unknown cause. Florence police are being supported in their investigation by UN arms experts.  ",

North Korean sales of missiles, missile parts and other arms to countries such as Iran, Syria and Myanmar are believed to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to North Korea's hard-currency earnings. Although the sale of such relatively routine weapons would normally not be illegal, in this case it violates the ban imposed under a U.N. resolution designed to punish North Korea after it consistently violated UN-imposed sanctions over the past year. Thailand has asked the U.N. Security Council how to handle and dispose of the weapons, advice that has not so far been forthcoming.  ",

  "content": "Report Date:  10 March 2009  from the New York Times <br><br>  The scene in Leonid Minsky\u2019s hotel room on the night of February 1, 2009 could have been taken from a classic cult film: Minsky, middle-aged, pale and fat and dressed in a colorful silk robe, flanked by a quartet of Russian and Italian prostitutes. A pornographic film flickers in the background. Minsky, who is the registered owner of the Galleria Hotel in Soncino, a small town outside Milan, Italy, has transformed his two-room suite into an office, a party hall, and a hangout of shady European businessman.  Then, without warning, the police arrive at Room 341, putting an end to the party and apparently derailing the career of a prominent international gun smuggler.  It would be permanently derailed when Minsky was reportedly shot to death in his jail cell by a guard two days later.  Details of this event are sketchy. Although local police supposedly raided Minsky\u2019s hotel on a tip from an unpaid prostitute, the Times has acquired a report that shows the Rome customs police had had Minsky under surveillance since 1992 while investigating an international criminal organization involved in laundering international drug money through the foreign bank accounts of Italian businessmen. The report also says that in 1997 Italian intelligence services conducted a complex investigation on a criminal group of Ukrainian origins associated involved in international arms and drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and other offenses. A key leader in this organization is Minsky. That hot August evening in Soncino, police found $500,000 worth of uncut diamonds. Later analysis found most came from Russia -- no African origins could be confirmed despite the diamond scales later found in Minsky\u2019s Lagos office. They found receipts for diamond and gun shipments to Yemen. They found a duffel bag filled with more than $35,000 in American, Italian, Hungarian and Mauritian currency. From a briefcase and piles scattered around the rooms, police collected 1,500 documents -- in Russian, Ukrainian, French, German, Dutch, English and Italian -- relating to Minsky\u2019s wide variety of business operations. Specific findings included documents on his dealings in oil, timber and consumer goods; maps of the Kenya-Sudan border; an inquiry by Minsky concerning Nigerian civil engineering and bridge construction services; an offer from Minsky\u2019s Korean representative asking him to ascertain whether Liberian President Charles Taylor would be interested in establishing diplomatic relations with Pyongyang; and a record of a $30,333.23 payment to Anna Nicole Smith as \u201ca thank you and an apology.\u201d Most important, however, police found evidence of several proposed and realized arms deals. Leonid Minsky was part of a new generation of highly organized post-Soviet criminals whose power and success is largely attributable to the climate of chaos, poverty and disintegrating state apparatus that governs many former Soviet republics today. Mobsters have easy access to former Soviet Army stockpiles -- now considered surplus small arms -- favored by embargoed military groupings seeking cheap weaponry wherever they can get it. ",

Fighting has now spilled into Saudi Arabia, reportedly causing 240 villages to be evacuated and more than 50 schools to be closed,  Sigrid Khan of UNICEF said in a statement this week. The total number of people displaced by the conflict since 2004 has gone up to more than 175,000, from an estimated 150,000 only a few weeks ago. Some point fingers at destabilizing foreign influence in the regional affair, directed against the Saudi regime.  Yet, others insist that this is a problem rooted in domestic unrest. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. Al-Houthi founded a new movement called the Sha\u2018ab al-Muminin (the Young Believers) and acquired significant religious status amongst the Za\u2019idi population of northern Yemen.  But as the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kahn said. During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated. Lack of safe water, nutrition and hygiene is exerting a heavy toll on their health and well-being, and threatening their very survival, Khan said.  Camps for refugees are filled, and those who cannot obtain a place in the camps are collecting just outside. Yemen's official news agency SABA reported Friday it was working to establish new refugees camps, however, this will do little to solve the core problems. ",

The member said information his colleagues had gathered over the cache, pointed to a deal gone awry. The claim is corroborated by Internal Security Assistant Minister Jimiyu Michieka who told The Standard on Sunday the seizure of the weapons was exposed following a deal gone sour among the merchants of death, said to include civilians and security officers. Some senior officers at the Ministry Police Training College (MPTC) interviewed point to unresolved political intrigues that relate to the retention of Ita Adoyo who should have retired last year. An inspector, who cannot be named for fear of reprisals, claims it was unusual for items to leave the armoury without the knowledge of senior officers. Even more intriguing are revelations that the force\u2019s firearms and ammunitions records are updated daily. Requisitions from districts and units \u2014 MPTC, Security of Government Buildings, Rapid Deployment Unit and Rural Border Patrol Unit \u2014 are approved by the Force Commandant. He should be the one answering the questions about how arms ended in civilian custody as claimed, the source said.Arms acquisition, it also emerged, is steeped in corruption. What raises more questions is that the armoury is under CCTV surveillance and armed guard round the clock. Asked about how this is feasible, Michieka  said, This is a sensitive matter. I am not privy to information about how the force keeps its records or secures the armoury. From the look of things this is just a deal gone sour.",

Al-Kalid was quoted by the state-run TruthToday.net as warning that the Ministry would be all over all who sell secretly or in public any pieces of weapons. The Ministry will never allow the death trade to appear again after we took an unprecedented step to eliminate this distressing way to make money through death, he added Yemen's efforts at internal control started after 9/11 with the new international focus on terrorism. The Yemeni government embarked upon a widely known weapons buyback program, hoping to neutralize the threat they posed to government control, in a non-confrontational manner. Yemeni authorities have shut down all arms businesses in anticipation of the introduction of a new licensing system in a bid to control the trade in a country with one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world. The Interior Ministry will take on the task of regulating weapons purchases in the country through the official licensing and monitoring of dealers and dealerships. Yemen has an estimated 60 million firearms in private hands, roughly three for every man, woman and child. Gun ownership has long been seen as an essential part of Yemeni culture. ",

  "content": "Report Date:  23 June 2008 from saudiscene.au<br><br>JEDDAH // Saudi Arabia has said it will allow the sale of personal firearms in an attempt to undercut the illegal arms trade in the kingdom, in a move many see as aimed at militants and Yemeni arms dealers who are benefiting from the current insurgency in Yemen.  The decision, however, has raised concerns that the greater availability of weapons could lead to an increase in violent incidents among ordinary Saudis.  Arms smuggling is on the rise in the kingdom, especially in the south where it is a big business for Yemeni arms dealers who smuggle the arms into neighboring Saudi, where many of them are sold to al Qa\u2019eda and other anti-government militants.  In the southern Jazan and Assir provinces, carrying a firearm is part of the local culture and many people there do not have permits for their firearms.  Last month, a unit of Saudi National Guards known as the Mujahidin issued a statement saying it had seized a large shipment of weapons \u2013 which included hand grenades, explosives, guns and ammunition \u2013 in Dafa valley when it intercepted arms smugglers led by a notorious arms merchant Saleh Ahmed, who fled back to Yemen.  <br>In Saudi, there is a 1,000 Saudi riyal fine for anyone who carries licensed arms in public places. A Mr. Haik Hosain recently incurred a punishment of eight months in jail and a 6,000 Saudi riyal fine for possessing an unlicensed firearm.  He was suspected of arms dealing in Saudi, but was not charged. More serious violations, such as using unlicensed firearms, can result in a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine of up to 300,000 Saudi riyals.",
